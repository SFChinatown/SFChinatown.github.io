                <h2>(Re)Imagining Community Safety: Asian American Encounters with Police Brutality</h2>
                <p>In 2021, amidst the increase in reported anti-Asian hate crimes, the movement to #StopAsianHate meandered towards a vague goal of community safety.<sup>1</sup> In response to this uptick of violence, only a year after Black Lives Matter uprisings called for dismantling the police, calls came from within urban Asian communities to increase law enforcement.<sup>2</sup> One GoFundMe raised over $100,000 to fund private security in Oakland, a predominantly Black city, to protect Asian elders.<sup>3</sup>  These discussions of community safety have dominated Asian political spaces, but have been largely disconnected from the histories of Asian American communities with the police in their focus on policing and carceralism as solutions to anti-Asian violence.</p>
                <p>Asian American political activism and the Third World Liberation movement exploded in San Francisco in the 1960s and served as a major impetus for the movement to save the International Hotel.  Opposing U.S. intervention in the Korean/Vietnam War, Asian American organizers saw themselves aligned with those fighting for freedom from imperialism in Asia, articulating American state violence as their common enemy.<sup>4</sup> The Filipino manongs spending summers in the Central Valley to harvest crops and winters in Seattle shucking oysters fought the same system that the KDP peasant organizers in Mindanao fought.  Maoism’s influence stretched from China to San Francisco Chinatown, where it helped to shape the attitudes of the International Hotel liberation struggle.<sup>5</sup>  Now, with the dialogue of mainstream Asian American activism shifted from liberation to representation and security, it’s worth questioning why conditions of community safety today revolve largely around policing.</p>
                <p>When discussing the International Hotel, activists’ memories of the police are rarely fond. Even before the resistance movement started, police violence was a weapon utilized by white predators in the Chinatown area. Harvey Dong, a UC Berkeley professor of ethnic studies and former owner of Everybody’s Bookstore in the International Hotel, recalled:</p>
                <p className="callout">A Chinese man that I knew, who was aware of [a white man’s history of sexually harassing children]...tried to stop that child molester from harassing a little girl. And the police were called on [the Chinese man], and the police went to arrest him. I saw that and I explained to the cops what was going on, and they arrested me, also. And the person that was being accused of molestation got away.<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>Dong’s story reveals the success of racial profiling against Asian Americans.  He elaborated on the story, saying, “I think [the police believed him] because he was a white man.”<sup>7</sup> Further, Dong’s recollection demonstrates a lack of investment in community safety by the police, and how police instead prioritize property and the maintenance of racial apartheid. . Situations like this weren’t uncommon, either. In 1975, in New York Chinatown, 27-year-old Peter Yew was beaten to death by police for attempting to intervene in their assault on a 15-year-old at a traffic stop.<sup>8</sup>  Beyond physical assaults, police were recorded holding unwarranted raids on business and legal aid groups.<sup>9</sup> The Red Guard Party, a Chinese American youth organization, wrote in 1971, “The people of Chinatown want an end to their colonization and exploitation. The people of Chinatown want the freedom to determine their own destinies. The people of Chinatown want an immediate end to police brutality and harassment.”<sup>10</sup></p>
                <p>As the struggle progressed, community members only became more vulnerable to police violence as they repeatedly resisted eviction at the I-Hotel.  Police horses were brought to the picket line to intimidate protestors, and they did so successfully.  Estella Habal, an activist who was inside the building during the final eviction of tenants on August 4, 1977, described the horses as “terrifying” and the police as “look[ing] like monsters.”<sup>11</sup>  Photographs of the picket line depict a scene which echoes this sentiment.</p>

                <p>Heavily armed police officers arrived in droves, ready and able to cause serious harm to tenants and protesters that they encountered. Pam Lee, an activist at the eviction, described, “Human flesh, however determined, is no barrier to hooves and riot sticks. The police were out for blood.”<sup>12</sup> The <i>Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino Newspaper</i><sup>13</sup> reported that</p>
                <p className="callout">First using horses, the police urged the frightened beasts into the crowd and proceeded to use their batons to bash heads in a futile effort to form a corridor to the door.  The second charge were police on foot who brutally and indiscriminately started hitting people.<sup>14</sup></p>
                <p> Seventeen protestors were injured by the police over the course of the eviction; five of those were hospitalized.<sup>15</sup> </p>

                <p>The eviction, carried out by 400 police officers, was led by Sheriff Richard Hongisto, who had previously been incarcerated for five days after refusing to evict the I-Hotel tenants.  Hongisto, who led the eviction, described it as “one of the most distasteful things I have had to do since I've been in office.”<sup>16</sup> The leader of the Sheriff’s department being unable to prevent these evictions from happening, despite a seeming investment in allowing tenants to continue to live in the building, demonstrates policing’s investment in capital above all else; the drive to protect property and wealth maintains a grip so iron on law enforcement that even police leadership lacked the authority to put a stop to the evictions.  </p>
                <p>When evaluating moments in which police did demonstrate an investment in Asian American communities, the most prominent examples still reveal the prioritization of property over life—which is how American policing was designed.<sup>17</sup>  As some Asian Americans have been granted increasing access to social mobility in the near-fifty years following the International Hotel struggle, the bonds of solidarity with other marginalized groups—particularly Black Americans—have weakened.<sup>18</sup> </p>
                <p>Fundamentally, this redirects back to the “model minority myth,” not in how it oppresses Asian Americans, but in how it protects them. Proximity to whiteness, made possible by distance from Blackness, has often acted as a shield against police violence. But this proximity isn’t enough to keep Asian Americans safe. In 2020, Asian teenager Christian Hall dialed 911 as he was attempting suicide; rather than intervene for his safety, Pennsylvania State Police shot and killed him after mistaking his airsoft pellet gun for a lethal weapon.  In 2021, police ruled that the murder was justified.<sup>19</sup> Also in 2020, a Filipino man named Angelo Quinto in Antioch died after having his neck knelt on by a police officer. The district declined to charge the officer.<sup>20</sup> </p>
                <p>It’s apparent that there is a need to improve community safety, but it is equally clear that police are unable to provide it. Instead, Asian American scholars and activists have pointed to community-based safety as an effective and viable alternative.  Scholars have identified preventative practices as the most effective measures of reducing crime—both when they reduce risk factors for crime and shield vulnerable victims.  Providing housing for vulnerable community members—those who are low-income, or elderly—decreases their exposure to potential violence.  Furthermore, housing demonstrably decreases instances of theft, robbery, trespassing, loitering, and prostitution, some of the primary low-level offenses that result in incarceration.<sup>21</sup> Activists, in turn, have launched movements to expand access to affordable housing, including through the mission of today’s revival of the International Hotel.</p>
                <p>Community safety comes down to investment in human life, not property or capital.  Police, by design, are a capitalist tool to protect private property; capitalism is the base of class difference that serves as a criminal risk factor in so many circumstances.<sup>22</sup>  Instead of funding the acquisition of tanks or equipment that costs $1,800 per officer,<sup>23</sup> that money could be reinvested into schools, housing projects, social services, and accessible healthcare—some of the things provided by the International Hotel, which police were instrumental in destroying.  In 1977, an editorial in <i>Ang Katipunan</i> bluntly reminded readers that “when it came down to a choice between buying housing or buying cops, the ‘City That Knows How’ bought cops.”<sup>24</sup> If the struggle for the International Hotel has demonstrated anything, it’s that safety is community constructed and community defended; it cannot be found in state violence.</p>
