                <p>Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) was founded in 1969 to advocate for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community against racial injustice. Over the last 50 years, the CAA has continually challenged systemic discrimination, prioritized the community, and created bridges. Some of the CAA’s historic milestones include preparing for the Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols, protesting the murder of Vincent Chin, and working with community leaders to campaign for the building of the City College of San Francisco (CCSF) Chinatown and North Beach Campus. The CAA still works closely with CCSF, organizing events and creating programs to benefit the community.</p>
                <p>To learn more about the CAA’s historical and current activism in education, I reached out to Sally Chen, the CAA’s Education Equity Policy Manager. A San Francisco native, Chen graduated from Harvard with degrees in History & Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. After working with the CA Labor Federation and providing services in Boston’s Chinatown, Chen returned to San Francisco and joined the CAA in hopes of continuing their work back at home. In these excerpts from our interview, Chen delved into the importance of positionality, intersectionality, and adaptability as an activist.</p>

                <p><i>INTERVIEW: Sally Chen, Chinese for Affirmative Action Education Equity Policy Manager. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNGL219JXXVXemzD6H4iaFV1euycDRNIZ-FnuRuCyIA/edit">Complete Transcription and Notes</a></i></p>

                {/* Interview */}
                <p className="question">Can you please introduce yourself and tell me a little more about your job as the Education Equity Policy Manager at CAA?</p>
                <p className="answer">“My name is Sally Chen. I'm the Education Equity Policy Manager at Chinese for Affirmative Action in San Francisco. <b>CAA is a civil rights organization founded in 1969 out of the Asian American Movement, very much in the legacy of scrappy student-led organizers who wanted to really advance a mission that we still carry today, which is to defend and advance the civil and political rights of Chinese Americans and also advance multi-racial democracy</b>. So this takes form in a lot of different ways. CAA has several issue areas: education, equity, economic justice, civic engagement, language access, and community safety as well as immigrant rights. We have a lot of different touchpoints on doing work and being a progressive voice in and on behalf of Asian American communities. But we are also first and foremost in coalition with other organizations. Whether that's our language access network, or current voting collaborative, we work very closely with other community-based organizations. </p>
                <p className="answer">My work as an equity policy manager –  I can say a little bit about myself. I'm originally from San Francisco born and raised, came up through the public school system, and a lot of my experiences being the daughter of Chinese immigrants who worked in restaurants, worked in Chinatown bakeries – <b>a lot of those experiences really shaped and informed perspectives that I bring to how we look at equity today and how we look at trying to address systemic barriers, so that more people have more access to sort of life-changing opportunities such as education and training at the kind of like broader advocacy level, but also trying to address people's direct needs.</b></p>
                <p className="answer">So to that end, <b>CAA also advances advocacy but also has lots of touchpoints around direct services and civic engagement. So trying to inform people about their rights and also, you know, connect them with real opportunities</b>. So whether that's filing for a green card, helping them find work, or to enroll at City College, that's a lot of the direct ties that we have that often translates into policy advocacy.”</p>
            
                <p className="question">What is Chinese for Affirmative Action and what is the educational history behind the organization? What does the organization stand for?</p>
                <p className="answer">“<b>Our name in terms of affirmative action actually comes from relation to employment, which a lot of people don't often think about when it's brought up today</b>. But a lot of our advocacy started around making sure that there was access to job opportunities for Chinese Americans. So whether that included things like working as a firefighter or working in the city government or in good construction jobs, trying to make sure that communities, particularly people of color who had been excluded from a lot of these areas of work historically, were able to get a chance to actually have these positions when they were available, particularly when they were local. So, for example, when there was construction in Chinatown going on, we wanted to make sure that the local residents, often Chinese immigrant residents, had a chance to actually benefit from the job opportunities, like economic mobility that was available cause of those projects.</p>
                <p className="answer">That's just the approach that we had in our founding history. <b>But another area we were founded around was advancing the legal case Lau v. Nichols in the San Francisco Unified School District. That essentially was also about affirmative action, right?</b> It was the idea that providing education only in English did not actually mean providing meaningful access to education.</p>
                <p className="answer"><b>But if it wasn't actually accessible to everyone, then that doesn't make it an actual equal education</b>. That's not enough that you need to provide affirmative opportunities. It's not just about giving everybody the same treatment, but that you need to actually take additional steps to make sure there's meaningful access, whether that's jobs or education or otherwise for different groups. <b>So when we talk about affirmative action it's not just in education, it's also in employment. It's also in public contracting. It's also about language access. It's about making meaningful opportunities for all people, and particularly for people who have been historically excluded.</b>”</p>

                <p className="question">Jumping back in history, since my research is centralized around CCSF and the significance of the Chinatown / North Beach Campus, I especially want to know more about CAA’s advocacy for the building of the campus. What was CAA’s main contribution to this movement and why was it so important to the community?</p>
                <p className="answer">“City College classes that were available in Chinatown or in the area were basically just in whatever buildings that the teachers and the staff could find. So that could be basements of churches, community organizations during off hours, but the main campus for a long time up until the nineties was out of an old elementary school. And the site itself was really run down. There was a lot of issues. Parts of the ceiling were coming down, the desks and the bathrooms were built for children, not for adults. And there was just a lot of need, right? <b>This expanding need for vocational training for ESL classes, citizenship classes and this really rapid conclusion that the facilities that were available in Chinatown were not enough, that they needed to be renovated</b>. So Prop A, at the time, created investment for both San Francisco Unified School District and the college to acquire and build an actual permanent campus.</p>
                <p className="answer">And the actual site was the parking lot. It was just a parking lot at the time, and it was really hard to find a place that was not displacing residents. The site was actually secured, but the actual building of the campus was blocked because essentially <b>a lot of business interests, local hotels, and a lot of the politicians that they donated to really came out against the construction of the site. They wanted to – they advanced all kinds of different tactics to try to block the construction. Because it would essentially affect their business interests, whether that was about blocking their 360 panoramic views from the hotel or bringing in traffic – whether that's foot traffic, by train, or by car – people who are not their usual customers</b>.</p>
                <p className="answer">However, <b>it was actually an investment into an institution that would serve working people in Chinatown or Chinese Americans, even like Chinese community members across the city would come to a central location, to a state-of-the-art newly built campus that was promising to serve the needs of the Chinese community. So the role of CAA in that was really ramping up and turning out community support, because the only way to essentially turn the tides, against sort of organized political interests that had already essentially bought and had the ears of the politicians who were involved, was to make sure that there was really mass popular support</b>.</p>
                <p className="answer">We couldn't meet the needs of community members in a two-story building or something like that. There's actually so many pieces that needed to be addressed. <b>And as it is today, it is really state of the art. There is a full kitchen. There's an auditorium like multiple stories. And it actually is a real cornerstone of what fits into sort of like the Chinese community landscape, especially as a campus.</b>”</p>

                <p className="question">Especially demonstrated by the involvement in the Lau v. Nichols Supreme Court decision, one pillar that Chinese for Affirmative Action represents is clearly educational equality. What are some misconceptions about educational inequality and affirmative action? How does CAA work to combat them?</p>
                <p className="answer">“So the first thing that I always do when I talk about affirmative action is I try to contextualize first – for CAA, what's the bigger picture beyond higher education and Affirmative Action? Because there, there's so much more that we need to think about when we're talking about race-conscious policies. We could talk about scholarships, dedicated scholarships for Asian American students, Asian American affiliate groups on campuses, culturally competent mental health counseling for students. There are lots of things that are race conscious and we need race-conscious solutions to issues that are caused by racism. And that there is this need to really talk about this big picture when higher education is this one piece of that.</p>
                <p className="answer">All of this is interconnected. Higher education is just one piece of a person's journey for obvious reasons. It's four years or, or maybe more, maybe less. But there are so many other areas that this impacts in terms of actually addressing the misconceptions about affirmative action. That it is the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. It is one part of that, is one tool to address the fact that barriers still have existed historically and still exist. And that it's just one piece of the picture.</p>
                <p className="answer"><b>It was very much in addressing the legacies of slavery against Black Americans. The redlining, segregation, the de facto institutional racism that had existed for years after the end of slavery, still have an impact. Simply removing barriers or trying to undo racist policies is not enough. You actually need to proactively open doors and create, whether that is job opportunities or educational opportunities. You need to create pathways for people to actually reach stability and success. So a lot of the history and the bigger picture work, we try to center when we're trying to combat these misconceptions.</b></p>
                <p className="answer"><b>I think some of the misconceptions are that Asian Americans don't benefit from affirmative action, which is just fundamentally not true. We can look at these historical cases. We can look at real issues that Asian Americans face today. We can talk about the bamboo ceiling. We can talk about the anti-Asian incidences of violence that still occur. There are many ways in which racism against Asian Americans still exists and why in fact, our groups need policies that are race conscious, like affirmative action, in order to address these issues and talk about the nuts and bolts of the Supreme Court cases that are moving forward right now related to affirmative action. In fact, there was no evidence at all that Asian Americans are harmed by affirmative action</b> policies in higher education.</p>
                <p className="answer">Big picture grounding is necessary, but we're also here to address the specifics. And there's a lot of like misinformation that is out there. Affirmative action as it is right now in college admissions is more about holistic review, right? So is taking race as one factor among many – alongside gender, geography, religion, what major you want to apply under as one among many factors into consideration when the admissions officers are trying to create a class of students. </p>
                <p className="answer"><b>It's not just about clarifying the realities of Asian American students, but it's also about making sure that it's clear that we're in solidarity with other communities of color. The issue around affirmative action in and as it relates to education equity is that it's often framed as a white issue. It's pitting Asian American against other communities, when in fact we have more struggles and face more barriers in common than not</b>.”</p>

                <p className="question">How has the dynamic between race and educational equality (via affirmative action) changed over the last few decades? How has it changed specifically for Asian Americans? Has CAA’s positionality shifted as a result?</p>
                <p className="answer">“Over the last few decades a lot of changes are related to population growth and how shifts have happened right after the nineties, when family-based immigration really ramped up. We've seen this like real increased growth in the size and the diversity of what Asian America looks like. So, when we talk about CAA's origins – the sixties and the seventies – I think the experiences of Asian Americans at that time very much focused on different populations than we see today. We've had a lot of fights and advocacy from second generation, often Chinese Americans. So when you think about like City College early kind of fights, right? Like a lot of the advocates were second generation, but amongst the students [we] see this growth of more first generation immigrants who advocate for themselves.</p>
                <p className="answer">Not just for the campus, but for the classes that they were in, the ESL classes that they were in. And that has changed. We didn't used to have as many service programs for recent immigrants as we do now. We were thinking in terms of – thinking about where the greatest needs are within the Chinese American community, and that has shifted in terms of like where we see our work. </p>
                <p className="answer"><b>When you look at the City College of San Francisco, the number of Asian American students that are served at CCSF is more than the number of all Asian American students served by all the schools in the Ivy League. When you think about the scale of this number of students that are served and the impact that it has</b>, we can't just advocate for more spaces or for expanded support for Asian Americans in these really exclusive spaces. We actually have to also think about where the majority of Asian American students are. </p>
                <p className="answer"><b>The statistic that often shocks people – I think it's like 43%, but almost half of all Asian Americans in higher education are in community college. They're not at elite institution</b>. So institutions like City College don't need affirmative action policies, because they don't reject students generally speaking. <b>If you have truly accessible schools and where you have a truly accessible system, where everybody who wants to access an education can get one, that's a very different picture than saying, “We need affirmative action to try to divvy up limited spots that are competitive for whatever reason.” If you can imagine a community college system that provides education that is top quality, if we really invest in those teachers, those resources, and you're getting a Harvard level education, why can't everyone have something like that? So I would say like that's some of what we've been trying to navigate</b>.</p>

                <br/><br/>

                <p className="question">CAA has participated in intersectional activism, advocating against gender discrimination in the SFPD. Can you speak to the importance of focusing on intersectionality in educational equality, especially in regards to old immigration laws? As CAA is based out of Chinatown, how do you see intersectionality manifest in Chinatown – both through activism and disparity?</p>
                <p className="answer">“To talk a little bit about old immigration law history, <b>the first race-based immigration bans were targeting Chinese immigrants when we look at the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. But that law was actually predated by the Page Act, which specifically targeted Asian women or Chinese women under the assumption that all Chinese women coming to the United States were engaging in some form of illegal activity, or alleging essentially sex work</b>. That there is in the very roots of where a lot of these like racist, discriminatory immigration laws come from. It’s this very deeply both raced and gendered lens. And that really carries through in a lot of ways in what we're seeing today.</p>
                <p className="answer">I'll give an example of that that comes to mind since that's related to our most recent work. This is related to more of our community safety work. But when we're talking about like incidences of anti-violence and <b>our work in collaborating with Stop AAPI Hate, a lot of incidences particularly related to street harassment are building on the efforts of a lot of organizations that focused on issues impacting women and trans people</b>.</p>
                <p className="answer"><b>Street harassment is a race, class, and gendered issue. How do we address the issue of like public safety where often perpetrators of street harassment are coming from a very patriarchal lens? That is really problematic and affects multiple communities. And how do we work in collaboration with other groups that have actually already made a headway on this issue?</b> In that trying to address public safety does not does not mean more policing, right? When we see the impacts that increased police presence has in terms of creating harm for Black communities, LGBT communities, we work with groups that have already been advancing this issue for a long time to come up with new solutions.</p>
                <p className="answer"><b>One of the key messaging points that we land on in discussion with other organizations, including Alliance for Girls in California, has been trying to shift the idea that public safety and like issues of street harassment are public health issues – just like in the ways that we can talk about gun violence as a public health issue</b>.</p>
                <p className="answer">That needs a systemic response. There are real impacts that you can actually measure and that there needs to be actual funding to address for where this comes up. </p>

                <img src={require('../../assets/images/cfaa/CAA_6.JPG')}/>
                <br/><br/>

                <p className="question">What is a current project or cause CAA is focusing on that you’re excited by?</p>
                <p className="answer">“<b>There's a campaign that CAA working on called No Place For Hate that is focusing on transit safety – incidences of harassment that happen on public transit and trying to quantify the issue because there has not been any efforts to do that before, also, to address it. Whether that is about how you actually set up your bus stops, having adequate lighting, having physical presence by staff, non law enforcement staff and what that can do to change what public safety looks like</b>.</p>
                <p className="answer">To make this tie just back to education equity, it's not so much what No Place For Hate is working on right now, but a lot of the ties that I see are related to campus safety. Like the issue of sexual harassment on university campuses, on bullying, on those kind of issues too, right? Like if we're thinking about like public spaces where these happen most frequently, schools, in addition to like streets, transit, businesses, schools are also a big nexus for where we see a lot of incidents reported too. So that is an interesting part of what we're trying to work on. But at least on the state level, No Place For Hate is focusing primarily on like businesses, public spaces and transit.</p>
                <p className="answer">But I think there's a lot to do too on the next frontier of like thinking about about schools too. [At CAA] <b>the Chinese Digital Engagement team is doing really fascinating work to combat misinformation and disinformation and fact checking. They do a lot of the heavy lifting on multiple issues (affirmative action, model minority myth) in terms of pushing it out and getting it to audiences that are in that movable middle</b>.”</p>
