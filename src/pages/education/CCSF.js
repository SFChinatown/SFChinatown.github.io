                <h2>City College of San Francisco Chinatown/North Beach Campus</h2>
                <p>Today, City College of San Francisco’s (CCSF) Chinatown/North Beach campus stands tall as a pillar of higher education in Chinatown. The 14-story building houses nearly 40 classrooms, offices, laboratories, a library, a community auditorium, a teaching kitchen for culinary studies, a café, and more. Its establishment on the corner of Kearny and Washington, at the edge of San Francisco Chinatown, was made possible by seventeen years of community activism.</p>
                <p>As a college, CCSF has over 100,000 students. According to a Student Demographics study done in 2019-2020, the CCSF student population was 36.6% Asian and Pacific Islander, 5.8% Black or African American, 27.1% Latine, and 16.9% White<sup>1</sup>. The community college has both credit-based and free non-credit ESL (English as a Second Language) classes, offering Literacy (Level 1 to 9), Vocational/Workplace ESL, Computer Skills, Citizenship, and College Preparation courses to students and community members<sup>2</sup>. As Amber, a CCSF student, stated in her testimonial, “new immigrants face challenges from overcoming cultural barriers,” and CCSF offers opportunities for students and immigrants to overcome those barriers to build a future<sup>3</sup>. It is crucial to highlight these stories, as education has been a deeply important element in the Chinatown community—not only for children, but also adults who hope to learn English, technical skills, culinary arts, or other lessons for business, personal reasons, or recreation. </p>

                <h3>Before CCSF Chinatown: YMCA as a Community Resource Hub</h3>
                <p>The building of CCSF’s North Beach campus marks an immense and hard-won victory for higher education in Chinatown against corporate interests, but the fight for educational equity and justice within the Chinese American community has been long-standing in Chinatown prior to the City College system.</p>
                <p>	Before CCSF’s expansion into SF Chinatown, the first Chinese-American YMCA (founded in 1911) was a primary resource hub for Chinese immigrants and youth to receive educational and vocational services<sup>4</sup>. The YMCA has historically provided English lessons and social welfare services, ultimately becoming a space for the Chinese community to enrich the quality of life and education among the Chinese population living in SF Chinatown. The YMCA provided an alternative outlet for educational attainment, given the legacy of educational segregation and barriers that prevented Chinese students from attending mainstream schools in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>	The YMCA established a transnational relationship with Lingnan University (based in South China), which facilitated community lectures on health, religion, machinery, mechanical drawing, and table games that were offered in English and/or Mandarin<sup>5</sup>. Nevertheless, community members were constrained by the lack of accreditation available for knowledge-centered courses. Combined with racial discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment against Chinese laborers, many community members faced difficulties finding employment opportunities<sup>6</sup>. While serving as a vital community institution to support the integration and general welfare of Chinese families, the YMCA and its Lingnan extension were unable to sufficiently provide accredited educational services.</p>
                <p>	The need for higher education in close proximity to Chinatown was a constant issue for community members. In the late 1970s, the CCSF board voted to establish new branches of its campus and increase accessibility for different communities in San Francisco<sup>7</sup>. In 1981, the board signed a 20 year lease with the San Francisco Unified School District to repurpose the Hancock Grammar School for the Chinatown/North Beach branch of its campus<sup>8</sup>. Because the facility’s amenities were scaled for elementary schools and categorized as seismically unsafe, it struggled to properly serve the growing student population<sup>9</sup>. The need for relocation was clear to teachers, students, and community members. In 1998, there was an attempt to build a new campus at the Colombo Building on the northwest corner of Columbus Avenue and Washington Street, but corporate and liberal interests vehemently pushed back against its construction. The eventual failure of its fruition came at a great cost to those who were working hard to build a new home for the campus branch and its students<sup>9</sup>.</p>
                <img src={require('../../assets/images/ccsf/CCSF_3.JPG')}/>
                <br/><br/>
                <p>The eventual construction of the CCSF Chinatown/North Beach campus in 2008 was an enormous win for community members and organizations who had fought for its construction against corporate interests since the 1970s<sup>11</sup>.</p>
                <p>The new building was being proposed to replace the older Hancock School campus on Filbert Street. The desks, chairs, toilets, and sinks in the Filbert Street building had been built for children, and the buildings were dilapidated, with pieces of roof falling down onto students’ heads<sup>12</sup>. The complete disregard for educational spaces for the Chinatown community was a fight beyond redevelopment efforts. It was one that addressed the nationwide issue of educational access and raised “scholarly and political attention to the educational needs and interests of Asian immigrant and working adults,” as well as the obsession with the model minority myth that prompted city officials to overlook the aforementioned issues.<sup>13</sup> The 1989 earthquake was the final push for a collection of community organizations to fight for an improved North Beach campus that had proper facilities and amenities for its diverse student population.<sup>14</sup></p>
                <p>After much searching, a plot that was previously a parking lot was bought at the corner of Kearny and Washington Streets as a possible site for the development of the new campus<sup>15</sup>. The plot was right across from the Hilton Hotel, which would come to be a strong player in the opposition of the North Beach campus construction<sup>16</sup>. Located on the border between the Financial District and Chinatown, the site became embroiled in a clash between financiers and community interests.</p>
                <p>Local opinion of the building was fractured by this clash. The Friends of Educational Opportunities in Chinatown was formed as a coalition of community organizations supporting the construction of the new campus so that they could organize their efforts cohesively for the higher education building.<sup>17</sup> They utilized the slogan “Hilton Butt Out” to expose the Hilton as a leading corporate source of opposition towards the educational facility.<sup>18</sup> The Hilton and other businesses began to work behind the scenes to conduct meetings, lobby senators and city college officials, manipulate community members, and spread misinformation about the construction of this new educational center.<sup>19</sup> Collective corporate interests formed their own Educational Coalition for Responsible Development (none of which specialized in education). This coalition also tried to use the genuine concerns voiced by Chinatown community members towards their own personal interests.<sup>20</sup> </p>
                <p>An example of a legitimate concern, which was then co-opted by the Hilton and opposition, was the concern over shadows. Specifically, there was a question over whether or not the building would cast a shadow on the popular park at Portsmouth Square. The urban planners and organizations that were facilitating the building of the new Chinatown/North Beach campus took this concern seriously, and found that the shadow would cover only a small portion of grass and the staircase to and from the Portsmouth Square Parking Garage.<sup>21</sup> Their research also uncovered the hypocrisy of the Hilton and surrounding businesses for trying to co-opt the shadows argument, as they were contributing to the largest portion of shadows on the park at the time.<sup>22</sup> In addition to the gross hypocrisy of these businesses bringing up shadow ordinances, Prop K, the ordinance that protected public spaces and parks from shadow cover, had its roots deep in SF Chinatown community organizing.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, organizers rallied an overwhelming amount of student and community support in spite of lobbyists' misinformation. Thanks to the overwhelming support of community members, urban planners, attorneys, community organizations, and CCSF students, the board approved the final measures needed in order to start building the CCSF’s Chinatown campus, and the building was finished in 2008.<sup>23</sup> Since opening its doors in 2012, the building has stood tall as a testament to Chinatown's legacy of community organizing and cross-racial activism.</p>
