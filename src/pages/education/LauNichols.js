                <h2>Lau v. Nichols Supreme Court Case</h2>
                <p>In 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of educational access for non-English speaking students in <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, which originated from San Francisco Chinatown. This case set a precedent for students around the country who were immigrants, children of immigrants, or English language learners by opening up the American education system to bilingual education.</p>
                <p>San Francisco saw a sharp influx of immigrants from non-European and non-white nations with the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965.<sup>1</sup> This also correlated to an influx of students from abroad who were continuing their education at schools in the city, while speaking languages other than English.<sup>2</sup> These students were entering schools at their grade level, but struggling to understand what was being taught because they lacked a solid foundation in the English language. These “English-only” schools were isolating for students coming from immigrant and non-English-speaking backgrounds.<sup>3</sup> In addition, teachers in the district did not feel that they had adequate resources to teach English as a second language alongside the rest of the assigned curriculum and subjects.<sup>4</sup> In an official publication, the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) admitted that these students were “inevitably doomed to be dropouts and become another unemployable in the ghetto.”<sup>5</sup> The district itself recognized the lack of equitable educational resources, and the role that this disparity played in the impoverishment of Chinese families and children in the school district.</p>
                <p>In 1970, a collective of students, families, and community organizations in Chinatown rallied a class action lawsuit against the SFUSD with the help of Ling-Chi Wang, a UC Berkeley graduate student, and Edward Steinman, a Chinatown attorney.<sup>6</sup> The court case was named for Kinney Kinmon Lau, a first grader at Jean Parker Elementary on the northern edge of Chinatown, and Alan H. Nichols, the SFUSD Board of Education president at the time.<sup>7</sup> The lawsuit was initially denied by the District Court for the Northern District of California and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit before Chinatown community members appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The defendants argued that the school’s lack of resources for students with limited English proficiency constituted educational discrimination. They argued that providing resources for English language learners as well as instruction in students’ primary languages would create a culture in the classroom that maintained and celebrated students’ cultural identity.<sup>8</sup></p>
                <p>On December 10, 1973, the case was heard at the Supreme Court after being appealed from the lower courts. “Our goal is that we want these students to be taught English and to understand English, so that they can have the type of mastered English which our society requires. The problem now is that they are being taught in a language they do not understand,” said Edward Steinman, representing the plaintiffs.<sup>9</sup> While the Supreme Court seemed preoccupied with the question of whether classes would be taught in Chinese, Steinman framed education access as a larger issue of equity, saying that “the school system might wish to employ Chinese-speaking teachers in a bilingual setting, that is their choice. Our complaint is not with methodology. We’re not asking this Court to get involved in petty illogical questions. Our complaint is that right now, the school system is utilizing no methods <sup>to provide adequate education to students</sup>.”<sup>10</sup> The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the students, stating that “There is no equality of treatment merely by providing students with the same facilities… for students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.”<sup>11</sup></p>
                <p>After the case passed, the Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) and the Association of Chinese Teachers helped to train San Francisco teachers in the district to teach bilingual classes.<sup>12</sup> Using <i>Lau v. Nichols</i> as a precedent, subsequent court cases determined that bilingual education was an essential way to create educational equity for non-English speaking students.<sup>13</sup> One such 1974 case, <i>Aspira v. Board of Education of the City of New York</i>, resulted in the creation of a bilingual-bicultural education program for 200,000 Puerto Rican children in New York City.<sup>14</sup> However, many students and marginalized community members found that under the Lau precedent, school districts would evade comprehensive educational equity by only doing the bare minimum to meet legal requirements</p>
                <p>Despite <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>’ resounding impact, anti-immigrant sentiments have since challenged the presence of bilingual access to education, such as California Proposition 227 which passed in 1998.<sup>15</sup> Prop 227 stated that all ESL instruction must be taught in English, hoping to ban other languages from being spoken in the classroom.<sup>16</sup> That being said, San Francisco districts resisted the proposition using <i>Lau v. Nichols</i> as federal precedent to defend themselves and their bilingual classes in schools.<sup>17</sup> </p>
                <p> Overall, <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, which came from the heart of Chinatown’s struggle for educational access, represents a landmark case in bilingual education. This historic court case has opened up educational avenues for countless other non-English speaking immigrants in addition to the Chinese American population.</p>
