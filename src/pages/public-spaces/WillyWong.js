                <h2>Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground</h2>
                <p>Willie “Woo Woo” Wong playground opened in 1927 on a one-third acre lot bounded by Sacramento Street to the south and Hang Ah Alley to the west.<sup>1</sup> Then known as Chinese Playground, it was, and continues to be, one of the only public outdoor recreational places in Chinatown, serving as an oasis for children who live in crowded conditions and who want an open space to play and socialize. To account for Chinatown’s steep slopes, the playground is split into two levels. At present, the park includes play structures and a clubhouse on the lower terrace and a basketball court, a tennis court, and fitness equipment on the upper terrace.</p>
                <p>For much of its existence, the Chinese Playground was neglected by the local government and lacked adequate play equipment to serve its thousands of users. In 1968, when real estate developers took interest in the Chinese Playground as a potential site to build a new nine-story parking garage, they offered to construct a small play area on its roof, arguing that it was the only way to fund improvements to the site. Recognizing that a rooftop park would not serve the needs of the community, concerned Chinatown residents, workers and community activists formed an ad hoc group to protest the developer’s proposal. After collecting 5,000 signatures opposing the new parking structure, the group formed the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown (CBPRC).<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>The group began meeting monthly in the basement of Cameron House, a historic Church and community-based organization that provides domestic violence case management, counseling services, low-cost summer programming, and other community services. The CBPRC developed a working relationship with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, whereby a City Department staff member attended every meeting. As explained by former CBPRC member Jennie Lew, this partnership reaped many benefits for the Committee: “As we were talking about maintenance, improvement issues, even security problems, or whatever, we had a City staff person right in the meeting. As explained by former CBPRC member Jennie Lew, this partnership reaped many benefits for the committee: “As we were talking about maintenance, improvement issues, even security problems, or whatever, we had a city staff person right in the meeting. They either had the information or they were assigned to go back and get the information for us, and there was local city accountability.”<sup>3</sup> As a result of their effective advocacy, especially their presence at public City Hall meetings, the Board of Supervisors ultimately rejected the developers’ proposal.<sup>4</sup> </p>

                <p>However, the CBPRC was not content with simply stopping the bulldozing of the park. The group began to meet with staff members from the Recreation and Parks Department to discuss potential improvements to the park.<sup>5</sup> An anonymous $25,000 donation provided the funding needed.<sup>6</sup> To ensure that the community’s needs were met, the Recreation and Parks Department tasked the CBPRC to develop the playground design.<sup>7</sup> The organization partnered with the Community Design Center (CDC, a Chinatown branch established by Alice Barkley from the main CDC center located then and still now at UC Berkeley Extension in San Francisco) which provided architectural and planning services to underserved communities, including the Western Addition, Hunter’s Point, and Chinatown.<sup>8</sup></p>
                <p>The CBPRC has always recognized the importance of creating separate play spaces for toddlers and elementary school students. As Jennie Lew puts it: “An eight or twelve-year-old is gonna totally run over someone who is just learning how to walk...”<sup>9</sup> During the design process, CDC and CBPRC members worked directly with youth and children/family related community non-profits to develop ideas. Saint Mary’s School, one of many educational institutions in Chinatown, developed a slideshow entitled “The Poor Little Playground” to solicit input from children.<sup>10</sup> Teams of children used clay, wood, and other materials to build highly expressive and often whimsical models of what they wanted.<sup>11</sup> The CBPRC also developed close relationships with Chinatown child care centers, which relied almost entirely on neighborhood parks to meet outdoor minimum square-foot-per-child requirements to be certified. This allowed CBPRC to obtain valuable design feedback from both the children, parents, and staff working with youth in the community.<sup>12</sup> David Gates and the other landscape architects from Eckbo, Dean, Austin and Williams (EDAW) then volunteered to produce the Construction Documents for the first major Chinese Playground renovation.<sup>13</sup></p>
                <p>The design for the central area of the playground was completed after a year and a half of robust community engagement and fundraising efforts.<sup>14</sup> Implementing the design, however, required extensive negotiations with various government bodies, including the City Recreation and Parks Commission, the Art Commission, and the Department of Public Works. With the help of Recreation and Parks Department staff, the CBPRC was able to realize a pivotal renovation of the central play area, which served as a model for later phases of improvements, including subsequent addition of a "tot lot" area for younger children and a new clubhouse for indoor recreational activities (e.g., ping pong, board games, youth and parent gathering and community meetings).<sup>15</sup> </p>

                <h3>Chinatown Shadow Fights and Prop K, The Shadow Ordinance</h3>
                <p>In 1982, a powerful Chinatown Family Association put forth plans for a 12-story, $5 million condominium located directly uphill from the Chinese Playground between Stockton Street and Hang Ah Alley. The Ning Yung project proposed 29 luxury housing units above commercial space.<sup>16</sup>  A shadow study conducted by UC Berkeley Emeritus Professor Peter Bosselmann, from the College of Environmental Design Simulation Lab, confirmed that new construction would cast  major shadows over the playground’s tennis, volleyball, and basketball areas as well as the tot lot for 1-3 ½ hours throughout the year. <sup>17</sup> The CBPRC, residents and many other community organizations (e.g., childcare and youth centers, educational and social services) responded with alarm. In a newspaper interview, Jennie Lew argued that “it takes more to making a neighborhood than just housing. Part of it is (also) providing an environment where kids can grow and where a family can sustain itself with shops and places of work.”<sup>18</sup> Ning Yuen attempted to sway garment workers employed in the existing low-rise building (proposed for demolition and replacement by a new mid-rise condominium project) by offering to relocate them. However, many were mothers whose children had actually played at the Chinese Playground. Recognizing the importance of accessible outdoor play spaces to their family and the rest of the community, Asian Law Caucus attorney Ed Lee stated his clients, the on-site garment workers voted to oppose the condominium project in solidarity with the CBPRC.<sup>19</sup> </p>
                <p>The conflict continued to brew in City Planning Commission meetings for months before a compromise was finally reached. The compromise reduced the height of the building by twenty-seven feet and tapered the side of the building facing the Chinese Playground to allow more sunlight in the late afternoon. As a result, CBPRC ultimately withdrew opposition to the condo project when the Ning Yung Association also made a “good-faith” promise to acquire a new site for a park. The CBPRC also was aware there was no prior premise under the current Environmental Impact Report requirements or City ordinance that shadows could legally prevent new construction approvals or permits. Despite urging from Planning Director Dean Macris, the Planning Commission was hesitant to approve the compromise.<sup>20</sup> The project was finally approved in a contentious 4-3 vote, after heavy lobbying by Mayor Diane Feinstein.<sup>21</sup> In the end, the condominium project was never built. However, the “good-faith” compromise between the  Ning Yuen Association and activist groups would eventually lead to the city’s acquisition and development of the Cathay Mortuary Site as Woh Hei Yuen Park.<sup>22</sup></p>
                <p>Media coverage of this pivotal battle over shadows on a playground set in one of the densest, most populated, low-income neighborhoods in America established unequivocally the value of sunlight on public open space. Chinatown open space, which had previously taken a back seat to senior and housing issues, now had increased prominence and importance not only in the community, but was now a critical element for land use policies to assess and protect citywide. As Jennie Lew comments: “You live and die if you don’t have housing, right? [That is not the case with] open space. [But, without it], what kind of quality of life do you have?”<sup>23</sup>  The CBPRC continued to push for City funding for summer recreational programs and improved play structures in Ping Yuen public housing complexes and even rooftops (e.g., Chinatown Branch Library, now the Him Mark Lai Library). The CBPRC also advocated in other public hearings for better access, public transit connections, and more culturally and language sensitive features at regional recreational resources like the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and presented Chinatown case studies at a Sierra Club/NAACP joint Conference in Chicago. CBPRC as a leader/innovator in open space preservation and improvement gained prominence.<sup>24</sup> Other organizations in San Francisco began to see that the Chinatown community “knew how to argue for open space…[and were] not just a poor little minority community waiting for handouts.”<sup>25</sup> The extended conversations over the shadowing of parks eventually led to the passing of Prop K, The Shadow Ordinance, which embedded park sunlight protections into San Francisco’s City Charter.<sup>26</sup> Making policy impacts like Prop. K (still in existence and to this day, applied to all new developments proposing added shadows on public open spaces throughout the City), Chinatown emerged as a political force and as “a community to be dealt with.”<sup>27</sup></p>
                <p>In its earliest days, the CBPRC refused to concede any shadowing, regardless of square footage or time/season of impact if it landed on space that was usable then or potentially for future active or passive enjoyment by the community. Under Prop. K, only insignificant shadows were to be permitted by the City Planning Commission. Now, commercial developers in San Francisco approach community groups to buy off any opposition to their new project shadow impacts. "Significant or insignificant" negative shadow impacts before the City Planning Commission or subsequently even at the more politicalized S.F. Board of Supervisors level, are now weighed against enticing "community benefits". As a result, many current and proposed new improvements to Chinatown public open space or new affordable housing are funded in whole or in part by negotiated new office development agreements.<sup>28</sup></p>
                <p>Jennie Lew (CBPRC member that authored the "shadow ordinance" with SF Supervisors Bill Maher, Supervisor Lousie Renne and City Rec. and Parks Department General Manager Mary Burns) recalls "this was not what members of CBPRC had in mind when we conceived and fought for the Prop. K shadow ordinance. The Planning Commission rated Portsmouth Square and the Chinese Playground as where <b><i>NO new shadow would be allowed</i></b>. The whole objective of Prop. K was NOT to have shadow impacts be 'negotiables' on a case-by-case basis for all eternity between developers and CBPRC or other community groups, however, that's what the City and community has now accepted in Chinatown.”<sup>29</sup></p>

                <p>In 2006, the Chinese Playground was renamed to honor Willie “Woo Woo” Wong, a local basketball legend. Standing at five foot five inches, Wong grew up across from the playground on Sacramento Street. He would eventually go on to play for the 1945 All-City prep team and the San Francisco Saints, an amateur basketball team composed entirely of Chinese Americans. As a member of the University of San Francisco Dons, he was the first Chinese American basketball player to play at Madison Square Garden. The Willie Wong Playground is the first park in San Francisco named after a Chinese American athlete.<sup>30</sup> </p>
                <p>The playground continues to be an important community hub for the Chinatown neighborhood. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a non-profit organization called the Community Youth Center (CYC) opened a Community Hub in the playground’s clubhouse as part of San Francisco’s Community Hub Initiative. The initiative provided young people with distance learning support and extracurricular opportunities. The Willie Wong Community Hub focused on serving middle and high school-aged English language learners and those living in public housing and single-room occupancies (SROs).<sup>31</sup> </p>

                <h3>Renovating the Willie Wong Playground in 2021</h3>
                <p>In February 2021, the playground reopened after undergoing major renovations. The $14.5 million project was funded by the 2012 Clean and Safe Neighborhood Parks Bond, the San Francisco Open Space Fund, and the Downtown Park Fund, which requires downtown commercial developers to pay fees to support public services. Working in collaboration with the Chinatown Community Development Center, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department conducted trilingual surveys and focus groups of teens, daycare staff, and seniors. The resulting design includes clear references to Chinese iconography and mythology. In the central play area, a water dragon sculpture loops around a climbable two-level tower. A phoenix sculpture connects two play zones that cater to different age groups. Inside the clubhouse, a mural painted by local artist Julie Chang depicts black and white peonies—which symbolize honor and abundance—along with a red knot symbolizing good fortune and green bamboo lines.<sup>32</sup> </p>

                <p>Since its inception in 1927, Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground has been a battleground for open space issues in Chinatown, pitting young activists against powerful developers over and over again. The fight to preserve this contested space illustrates the importance of community-serving playgrounds. As journalist John King puts it: “These public spaces aren’t simply decoration. They’re part of the civic infrastructure that makes a place more or less livable—not as obviously essential as roads or power lines, but critical all the same.”<sup>33</sup></p>
