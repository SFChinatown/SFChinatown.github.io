                <p>Located at the corner of Powell and John Streets, the opening of Woh Hei Yuen Park in 1997 was eagerly welcomed by residents of Chinatown, many of whom lived in cramped conditions without a dedicated living room. After waiting 25 years, the park was seen as an answered prayer by the community.</p>
                <p>Proposed in 1974, Woh Hei Yuen Park is a small yet significant addition for Chinatown residents who had not seen a new park since the completion of the Chinese Playground in 1949 and the Chinese Recreation Center in 1927.<sup>2</sup> The opening of the park was celebrated on October 7, 1997, with lion dancers from the SF Police Department and the Wu Yee Children's Services. It was officially named Woh Hei Yuen, which means "Garden of Peace and Joy." The name was the winner of the community's 'Name the Park' competition held earlier that year.<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>Back in 1969, a successful suit against the City of San Francisco found that Chinatown had the least amount of public recreational facilities and resources in the entire city, even though it had the greatest need for open space. In the same year, a group of Asian American students from UC Berkeley concluded a massive study on the allocation of resources for recreational purposes in San Francisco.<sup>4</sup> It became clear that Chinatown was the most densely populated neighborhood with the least amount of public recreational facilities and resources for recreational purposes.<sup>5</sup> Since then, numerous studies have recognized the need for more open space in Chinatown, and many have examined various options for development and improvement. They included the 1971 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 701 Study, the 1978 Neighborhood Improvement Plan, and the "Open Space Alleyways" report.</p>
                <p>After a city study concluded in 1974 that Chinatown was in urgent need of more open space, members of the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown (CBPRC) started looking for a location suitable for a small park. It took many years since there was no undeveloped land in Chinatown, and it was difficult to find lots big enough for a park.</p>
                <p>In 1990, the CBPRC, local authorities, and city representatives chose the site where Cathay Mortuary had been located.<sup>6</sup> The Cathay site located at Powell and Jackson was ideal, given its central location and size of 13,500 square feet. It also consisted of seven contiguous lots under related ownership.<sup>7</sup> The evaluation criteria for the site included core area accessibility to cater to all age groups, especially seniors and small children, as well as its size and usability for creating both active play areas and landscaped spaces for passive enjoyment. Other criteria specified that no housing could be demolished, job displacement must be minimized, and any adverse environmental impacts such as traffic, shadows, and wind must be mitigated.</p>

                <p>Proposition I, passed in 1974, provided funding for open space in six “high need” neighborhoods.<sup>9</sup> However, it was only after a protracted legal struggle with the owner of the mortuary that the Board of Supervisors in 1987 voted to purchase a third-of-an-acre property through eminent domain. Efforts are foremost made to properly appraise the property targeted for acquisition by the City. If an agreed price and terms fail, the legal process then permits the “greater public good” to prevail with a forced sale at a “fair market price” by a government agency to the private owner.</p>
                <p>The City eminent domain of the Cathay Mortuary properties was an arduous and lengthy process, legally led by the City Attorney’s office (i.e., specifically Attny. Andrew Swart) and involving innumerable public hearings attended by a wide coalition of community non-profit organizations and countless individuals that supported the CBPRC for years. According to Terry Ow-Wing, a former  member of the CBPRC, the need for extra park space won over most people, even though some local residents might not look forward to playing in a park on the site of a former morgue. "If you believe in the community, you want to look forward and not look back," she said.<sup>10</sup></p>

                <p>The design and construction of the project were managed by the Department of Public Works and the Recreation and Park Department.<sup>12</sup> The planning process, which began in 1991, was led by the CBPRC and Rec and Park Department Planner Deborah Learner, with input from seniors, childcare providers, school children, and residents in eleven workshops. The initial plan incorporated their needs and suggestions, which were integrated by DPW (Dept. of Public Works) architects. The architectural firm Murokami and Associates joined the design process, and the $1.6 million Woh Hei Yuen Recreation Center building was constructed by DPW's construction crew and Lem Construction once the plan was finalized.</p>

                <p>Today, visitors are welcomed into the "garden of peace and joy" through an attractive arched gateway made of sculpted granite. The garden is adorned with slender trees, trellised seats draped with flourishing vines, and flowering bushes bordering the lawn. In one corner of the garden, a wooden bridge crosses over a dry creek, adding to its serene charm. Young children are drawn to the play area, which features a round sandbox, sturdy climbing structures, slides, and shiny plastic cars and tricycles.<sup>15</sup></p>
                <p>The recreation center boasts two floors, including a roof deck, and is equipped with a multipurpose recreation room that features a children's play nook, a 1,000-square-foot assembly room, and a kitchen. Operating seven days a week, the center offers a wide range of programs for individuals of all ages, ranging from preschoolers to senior citizens. For adults, there are programs such as drama classes, board games, ping-pong, English language courses, exercise sessions, Chinese Lion Dancing, and Kung Fu. Children between the ages of 3 and 14, from eleven different schools, participate in programs offered from Monday to Saturday. These programs include Kindergym, organized games, cooking classes, Chinese language lessons, homework assistance, seasonal sports, karaoke, and activities aimed at developing motor skills.<sup>16</sup></p>
