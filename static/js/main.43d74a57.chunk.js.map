Chinatown is the oldest Chinatown in North America and one of the largest and most influential ethnic Chinese enclaves outside Asia. With the onset of the California Gold Rush, San Francisco served as the entry point for Chinese migrants, mostly from the Guangdong Province, coming to California in search of fortune.  Beginning in the 1850s, Chinese merchants settled near Portsmouth Square and established shops, restaurants, and other services around Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) to provision miners heading inland in search of gold and to support the growing Chinese community. With the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, about 15,000 Chinese male workers were brought to California, and when the railroad was completed in 1869, many of these workers found their way to San Francisco as well as other cities where Chinese enclaves had formed. Chinatown expanded to the area bordered by Stockton, Kearney, California, and Broadway streets and became the only geographical space where Chinese were able to inhabit, purchase, and inherit dwellings within the City. Unwelcomed in other parts of the City, Chinatown quickly became the most densely populated area in all of San Francisco. \n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                As a result of rising anti-Chinese violence and widespread anti-Chinese sentiments, several legislations were passed to restrict Chinese immigration. The Page Act of 1875 effectively prohibited the immigration of Chinese women, while the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 expanded the prohibition to all Chinese laborers, thereby drastically curtailing Chinese immigration and the social reproduction of Chinese American families.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                When the Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the older parts of the City, discussions around the relocation of Chinatown emerged. However, the fear of loss of Chinese trade and labor in the City, along with pressures from the Chinese government thwarted these discussions, and Chinese merchants immediately began rebuilding Chinatown, drawing on orientalist motifs to present the grandeur of “Chinese culture” and to appeal to tourism.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                SF Chinatown endured over the decades, and with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Chinatown received a new wave of migrants. At the same time, the youth population became drawn into the Civil Rights movement, the anti-War movement, and the Third World Liberation Front. As Chinese American youth engaged in struggles for housing, healthcare, education, and public space, Chinatown became a critical site of social transformation. A range of organizations were founded to ensure sustained support for the community. And although Chinatown continues to evolve, the legacy of community struggle and activism remains strongly imprinted in its social infrastructure.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                Without contest, SF Chinatown has been the hub of Asian American activism and civil rights mobilization. It is the cultural-political center where Asian Americans have organized against anti-Asian violence since the Chinese exclusion era; advocated for immigrant access to bilingual education, better housing, and healthcare; and built a social infrastructure to serve its vulnerable populations. In short, this project takes the emblematic site of SF Chinatown to examine the politics of place-making for Asian Americans.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                This website attempts to capture some of the major themes reflected in the radical histories of San Francisco Chinatown.

Funded by the Future Histories Lab, a project of the UC Berkeley’s Global Urban Humanities Initiative, the course was cross-listed in three units, including the Asian American & Asian Diaspora Studies Program, the Art and Humanities, and the Environmental Design department.</p>\n                        <p>Students began the course by reading existing scholarship on SF Chinatown, accompanied with guest lectures and a guided tour of Chinatown. The class brainstormed ideas for how we wanted to organize our project, identifying five broad themes we felt were important to cover in a survey of Chinatown’s history: Housing, public space, public health, education, and cultural enterprise. We identified five locations as “anchoring sites” for the project based on existing community connections and availability of archives, with each site corresponding to one of the broad themes. In the following weeks, students broke into small groups according to these themes and dove into independent research in archives and with community members.</p>\n                        <p>The format of our platform was an important question as we wanted readers to maintain an awareness of time and space in Chinatown, while also communicating complex webs of relationships between people, places, and politics. After exploring several existing digital humanities platforms, we ultimately settled on the form that you see now, a website and interactive map coded from scratch by students. A small group of students focused on building the website, working closely with the other small groups to develop unique designs for each research theme.</p>\n                        <p>This first iteration of the project only represents the tip of the iceberg that is SF Chinatown’s vibrant history. While future classes will continue working on the site, the design and content of the website you see now is the product of our students’ hard work and diverse skills in research, multimedia journalism, web development, and design. Moreover, this project would not have been possible without the generosity of our community partners, who were eager to encourage our research. Thank you to the many community members across the Bay Area who fielded our emails, hopped on Zoom calls to answer questions, invited us to community events, gave us building tours, and shared their

However, formal education has always been a struggle for San Francisco's Chinatown. Segregationist laws, inadequate resources, and lack of bilingual education had created systemic and self-perpetuating oppression for recently arrived immigrants. Without the ability to learn English, many could never confidently leave the boundaries of Chinatown–severing what little chance they had at better-paying jobs downtown as well as the possibility of integrating with the larger SF community.\n\n                                Though many generations have passed and racially segregated education has collapsed, the dedication to bilingual education remains–not only as a resource to those who have recently arrived, but also as a symbol of Chinatown's resilience. Whether committing to broader representation or establishing more learning opportunities, educational issues have persisted at the forefront of Chinatown's politics. Education in Chinatown continues to empower immigrants and nurture their voice, building opportunity and a better San Francisco.\"\n                            />\n                            <div className=\"buttons\">\n                                <Link to=\"/education/ccsf-chinatown\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        CCSF - Chinatown \n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/education/cfaa\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Chinese for Affirmative Action\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/education/lau-nichols\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Lau v Nichols\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/education/model-minority\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        The Model Minority Myth\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='image'>\n                            <img src={require('../assets/images/Card_CCSF.jpg')}/>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                {/* Section 2: Public Health */}\n                <div className=\"theme-section odd\">\n                    <div className='text-image'>\n                        <div className='image'>\n                            <img src={require('../assets/images/Card_ChineseHospital.jpg')}/>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='description'>\n                            <TextBlock\n                                header=\"Public Health\"\n                                body=\"Healthcare in San Francisco Chinatown is a complex and interweaving issue, spanning from historical barriers in Chinese-American’s experience to access, the racialisation of disease, to recent concerns such as COVID-19 and the provision of mental health services.\n\n                                At the heart of this topic is the San Francisco Chinese Hospital, a community owned non-profit hospital founded in 1925 to provide much-needed medical care to a population that was historically excluded from Western medical institutions.\n                                \n                                In taking a snapshot at community healthcare, physicians and healthcare providers face challenges with linguistic differences and relationships with Traditional Chinese Medicine.

As a result, SF Chinatown became one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the country, as well as a bastion of affordable housing for low-income immigrants in an increasingly expensive city. From the 1930s to the present, Chinatown community members have taken it upon themselves to fight against the state for more affordable housing in their neighborhood. This has resulted in a long tradition of organizing that traces from the International Hotel in Manilatown, to Ping Yuen and Mei Lun Yuen, to the continued threat of gentrification to Chinatown today. This fight offers lasting lessons in community organizing and resilience in the face of capitalist interests, not just to preserve access to affordable housing, but to defend the place Chinatown residents call home.                                \"\n                            />\n                            <div className=\"buttons\">\n                                <Link to=\"/housing/i-hotel\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        International Hotel\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/housing/ping-yuen\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Ping Yuen\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/housing/mei-lun-yuen\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Mei Lun Yuen\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/housing/housing-community-today\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Housing and Community Organizing in Chinatown Today\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/housing/reimagining-community-safety\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Reimagining Community Safety\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='image'>\n                            <img src={require('../assets/images/Card_I-Hotel.jpg')}/>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                {/* Section 4: Arts & Culture */}\n                <div className=\"theme-section odd\">\n                    <div className='text-image'>\n                        <div className='image'>\n                            <img src={require('../assets/images/Card_KublaKhan.jpg')}/>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='description'>\n                            <TextBlock\n                                header=\"Arts & Culture\"\n                                body=\"From its very formation, San Francisco’s Chinatown has always been a site of community agency and empowerment. Faced with discrimination and prejudice outside the boundaries of Kearny, Powell, California, & Broadway, residents of Chinatown created for themselves a self-sustaining community, with everything from the likes of culturally-appropriate groceries to Chinese theaters and herb shops. Of great significance is Chinatown’s long list of cultural enterprises — with a vibrant history of arts, entertainment, and culture, Chinatown has been home to many notable places and events, like the iconic Golden Age nightclubs Kubla Khan and Forbidden City, the Golden Dragon Massacre, the long-standing community arts institution Kearny St. Workshop, and now, a new generation of high-end restaurants, like the Michelin star-earning Mister Jiu’s. These pieces of history have all been a part of forming the social fabric of Chinatown, and continue to shape Chinese American identities, community, and culture. Groups like the Grant Ave. Follies carry on the legacy of the Golden Age of Chinese Nightclubs, while artistic and cultural hotspots like the Kearny St. Workshop and Mister Jiu’s take charge of what it means to be Asian American. These are only some examples of the ways culture thrives in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Through art, community, and innovation, San Francisco’s Chinatown continues to be a beacon of Chinese diasporic culture in the United States and beyond.\"\n                            />\n                            <div className=\"buttons\">\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/grant-ave-follies\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Grant Ave Follies\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/kearny-street-wkshp\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Kearny Street Workshop\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/kubla-khan-nightclub\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Kubla Khan Nightclub\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/food\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Mr. Jiu's / Chop Suey (Food)\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/forbidden-city\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                       The Forbidden City\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/culture/golden-dragon\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                       The Golden Dragon Massacre\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n                {/* Section 5: Public Space */}\n                <div className=\"theme-section even\">\n                    <div className='text-image'>\n                        <div className='description'>\n                            <TextBlock\n                                header=\"Public Space\"\n                                body=\"Ensuring access to open space is essential for any successful city. Parks and plazas serve as important sites for people of all ages to socialize, exercise, and play. This is doubly true for underserved neighborhoods like Chinatown, which has served as a landing pad for multi-generational immigrant families throughout its history. Due to the high cost of living and a lack of economic opportunities, many of these families are forced to live in small, overcrowded spaces. Residents lack space to gather with friends and family. Despite knowing this intense need for open space, it is extremely challenging to address the issue due to the neighborhood’s lack of undeveloped land. As such, Chinatown has the smallest amount of park space per resident of any San Francisco neighborhood.\n\n                                Over the decades, disinvestment, bulky new construction, and bureaucracy have threatened Chinatown’s limited public spaces. Grassroots advocacy organizations like the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown have fought to preserve the quantity and quality of Chinatown’s public open spaces. Through legal battles, public-nonprofit partnerships, and community-centered design, they have successfully protected and improved the quality of Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground and Portsmouth Square. Through political maneuvering and creative designs, they have also expanded Chinatown’s open space portfolio to include the Alleyways Program and the Woh Hei Yuen Park.\"\n                            />\n                            <div className=\"buttons\">\n                                <Link to=\"/public-space/alleyeays\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Alleyways Program\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/public-space/portsmouth-square\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Portsmouth Square\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/public-space/willie-wong-playground\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Willie Wong Playground\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                                <Link to=\"/public-space/woh-hei-yuen-park\">\n                                    <button className=\"aux-site-btn\">\n                                        Woh Hei Yuen Park\n                                    </button>\n                                </Link>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div className='image'>\n                            <img src={require('../assets/images/Card_PortsmouthSquare.jpg')}/>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Theme","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport \"./Map.css\";\n\nconst Map = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"map\">\n            <h2>Interactive Map</h2>\n            <iframe src=\"https://sfchinatown.github.io/map/\"></iframe>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Map;","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport \"./Education.css\";\nimport CarouselHeader from '../../components/CarouselHeader';\n\nconst Education = () => {\n    return (\n        <div class='education'>\n            <div className=\"carousel\">\n            <CarouselHeader\n                    items = {[\n                        {\n                            path: 'education-carousel/image1.jpg',\n                            alt: 'CCSF',\n                            label: 'CCSF',\n                        },\n                        {\n                            path: 'education-carousel/image2.jpg',\n                            alt: 'CFAA',\n                            label: 'CFAA',\n                        },\n                        {\n                            path: 'education-carousel/image3.jpeg',\n                            alt: \"CCSF Campus\",\n                            label: \"CCSF Campus\",\n                        },\n                        {\n                            path: 'education-carousel/image4.jpeg',\n                            alt: \"CCSF Community\",\n                            label: \"CCSF Community\",\n                        },\n                    ]}\n                />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"education-overview\">\n                <h2>Education</h2>\n                <p>Access to education not only serves as a chance at a better life, but is also key to integrating with the larger community. However, formal education has always been a struggle for San Francisco's Chinatown. Segregationist laws, inadequate resources, and lack of bilingual education had created systemic and self-perpetuating oppression for recently arrived immigrants. Without the ability to learn English, many could never confidently leave the boundaries of Chinatown–severing what little chance they had at better-paying jobs downtown as well as the possibility of integrating with the larger SF community.</p>\n                <p>Though many generations have passed and racially segregated education has collapsed, the dedication to bilingual education remains–not only as a resource to those who have recently arrived, but also as a symbol of Chinatown's resilience. Whether committing to broader representation or establishing more learning opportunities, educational issues have persisted at the forefront of Chinatown's politics. Education in Chinatown continues to empower immigrants and nurture their voice, building opportunity and a better San Francisco.</p>\n            </div>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Education","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport \"./CCSF.css\";\nimport Tile from '../../components/Tile';\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst CCSF = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"ccsf-page\">\n            <div className='header'>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/ccsf/CCSF_1.JPG')} />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"ccsf-intro\">\n                <h2>City College of San Francisco Chinatown/North Beach Campus</h2>\n                <p>Today, City College of San Francisco’s (CCSF) Chinatown/North Beach campus stands tall as a pillar of higher education in Chinatown. The 14-story building houses nearly 40 classrooms, offices, laboratories, a library, a community auditorium, a teaching kitchen for culinary studies, a café, and more. Its establishment on the corner of Kearny and Washington, at the edge of San Francisco Chinatown, was made possible by seventeen years of community activism.</p>\n                <p>As a college, CCSF has over 100,000 students. According to a Student Demographics study done in 2019-2020, the CCSF student population was 36.6% Asian and Pacific Islander, 5.8% Black or African American, 27.1% Latine, and 16.9% White<sup>1</sup>. The community college has both credit-based and free non-credit ESL (English as a Second Language) classes, offering Literacy (Level 1 to 9), Vocational/Workplace ESL, Computer Skills, Citizenship, and College Preparation courses to students and community members<sup>2</sup>. As Amber, a CCSF student, stated in her testimonial, “new immigrants face challenges from overcoming cultural barriers,” and CCSF offers opportunities for students and immigrants to overcome those barriers to build a future<sup>3</sup>. It is crucial to highlight these stories, as education has been a deeply important element in the Chinatown community—not only for children, but also adults who hope to learn English, technical skills, culinary arts, or other lessons for business, personal reasons, or recreation. </p>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/ccsf/CCSF_2.JPG')} />\n                <br /><br />\n                <h3>Before CCSF Chinatown: YMCA as a Community Resource Hub</h3>\n                <p>The building of CCSF’s North Beach campus marks an immense and hard-won victory for higher education in Chinatown against corporate interests, but the fight for educational equity and justice within the Chinese American community has been long-standing in Chinatown prior to the City College system.</p>\n                <p>\tBefore CCSF’s expansion into SF Chinatown, the first Chinese-American YMCA (founded in 1911) was a primary resource hub for Chinese immigrants and youth to receive educational and vocational services<sup>4</sup>. The YMCA has historically provided English lessons and social welfare services, ultimately becoming a space for the Chinese community to enrich the quality of life and education among the Chinese population living in SF Chinatown. The YMCA provided an alternative outlet for educational attainment, given the legacy of educational segregation and barriers that prevented Chinese students from attending mainstream schools in San Francisco.</p>\n                <p>\tThe YMCA established a transnational relationship with Lingnan University (based in South China), which facilitated community lectures on health, religion, machinery, mechanical drawing, and table games that were offered in English and/or Mandarin<sup>5</sup>. Nevertheless, community members were constrained by the lack of accreditation available for knowledge-centered courses. Combined with racial discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment against Chinese laborers, many community members faced difficulties finding employment opportunities<sup>6</sup>. While serving as a vital community institution to support the integration and general welfare of Chinese families, the YMCA and its Lingnan extension were unable to sufficiently provide accredited educational services.</p>\n                <p>\tThe need for higher education in close proximity to Chinatown was a constant issue for community members. In the late 1970s, the CCSF board voted to establish new branches of its campus and increase accessibility for different communities in San Francisco<sup>7</sup>. In 1981, the board signed a 20 year lease with the San Francisco Unified School District to repurpose the Hancock Grammar School for the Chinatown/North Beach branch of its campus<sup>8</sup>. Because the facility’s amenities were scaled for elementary schools and categorized as seismically unsafe, it struggled to properly serve the growing student population<sup>9</sup>. The need for relocation was clear to teachers, students, and community members. In 1998, there was an attempt to build a new campus at the Colombo Building on the northwest corner of Columbus Avenue and Washington Street, but corporate and liberal interests vehemently pushed back against its construction. The eventual failure of its fruition came at a great cost to those who were working hard to build a new home for the campus branch and its students<sup>9</sup>.</p>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/ccsf/CCSF_3.JPG')} />\n                <br /><br />\n                <p>The eventual construction of the CCSF Chinatown/North Beach campus in 2008 was an enormous win for community members and organizations who had fought for its construction against corporate interests since the 1970s<sup>11</sup>.</p>\n                <p>The new building was being proposed to replace the older Hancock School campus on Filbert Street. The desks, chairs, toilets, and sinks in the Filbert Street building had been built for children, and the buildings were dilapidated, with pieces of roof falling down onto students’ heads<sup>12</sup>. The complete disregard for educational spaces for the Chinatown community was a fight beyond redevelopment efforts. It was one that addressed the nationwide issue of educational access and raised “scholarly and political attention to the educational needs and interests of Asian immigrant and working adults,” as well as the obsession with the model minority myth that prompted city officials to overlook the aforementioned issues.<sup>13</sup> The 1989 earthquake was the final push for a collection of community organizations to fight for an improved North Beach campus that had proper facilities and amenities for its diverse student population.<sup>14</sup></p>\n                <p>After much searching, a plot that was previously a parking lot was bought at the corner of Kearny and Washington Streets as a possible site for the development of the new campus<sup>15</sup>. The plot was right across from the Hilton Hotel, which would come to be a strong player in the opposition of the North Beach campus construction<sup>16</sup>. Located on the border between the Financial District and Chinatown, the site became embroiled in a clash between financiers and community interests.</p>\n                <p>Local opinion of the building was fractured by this clash. The Friends of Educational Opportunities in Chinatown was formed as a coalition of community organizations supporting the construction of the new campus so that they could organize their efforts cohesively for the higher education building.<sup>17</sup> They utilized the slogan “Hilton Butt Out” to expose the Hilton as a leading corporate source of opposition towards the educational facility.<sup>18</sup> The Hilton and other businesses began to work behind the scenes to conduct meetings, lobby senators and city college officials, manipulate community members, and spread misinformation about the construction of this new educational center.<sup>19</sup> Collective corporate interests formed their own Educational Coalition for Responsible Development (none of which specialized in education). This coalition also tried to use the genuine concerns voiced by Chinatown community members towards their own personal interests.<sup>20</sup> </p>\n                <p>An example of a legitimate concern, which was then co-opted by the Hilton and opposition, was the concern over shadows. Specifically, there was a question over whether or not the building would cast a shadow on the popular park at Portsmouth Square. The urban planners and organizations that were facilitating the building of the new Chinatown/North Beach campus took this concern seriously, and found that the shadow would cover only a small portion of grass and the staircase to and from the Portsmouth Square Parking Garage.<sup>21</sup> Their research also uncovered the hypocrisy of the Hilton and surrounding businesses for trying to co-opt the shadows argument, as they were contributing to the largest portion of shadows on the park at the time.<sup>22</sup> In addition to the gross hypocrisy of these businesses bringing up shadow ordinances, Prop K, the ordinance that protected public spaces and parks from shadow cover, had its roots deep in SF Chinatown community organizing.</p>\n                <p>Ultimately, organizers rallied an overwhelming amount of student and community support in spite of lobbyists' misinformation. Thanks to the overwhelming support of community members, urban planners, attorneys, community organizations, and CCSF students, the board approved the final measures needed in order to start building the CCSF’s Chinatown campus, and the building was finished in 2008.<sup>23</sup> Since opening its doors in 2012, the building has stood tall as a testament to Chinatown's legacy of community organizing and cross-racial activism.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className='tiles'>\n                <h2>Learn more</h2>\n                <Tile\n                header=\"CCSF Chinatown/North Beach Campus Tour\"\n                image={{\n                    link:\"/education/ccsf-chinatown/campus\",\n                    path:\"Card_CCSF_Campus.jpg\",\n                    alt:\"CCSF Chinatown/North Beach Campus Tour\"\n                }}\n                />\n                 <Tile\n                header=\"CCSF and the Community\"\n                image={{\n                    link:\"/education/ccsf-chinatown/community\",\n                    path:\"Card_KublaKhan.jpg\",\n                    alt:\"CCSF and the Community\"\n                }}\n                />\n            </div>\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup>CCSF Argos Institutional Headcount datablock. “CCSF Fact Sheet - Student Demographics,” September 2020.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup>CCSF (Maddi - not sure where you found this)\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup>Ibid\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>4</sup>Park, Roberta J. 2020. “Sport and Recreation Among Chinese American Communities of the Pacific Coast From Time of Arrival to the “Quiet Decade” of the 1950s.” Journal of Sport History 27 (3): 448.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>5</sup>Ibid, 460.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>6</sup>Wong, Scott K. 2005.

Nichols Supreme Court Case</h2>\n                <p>In 1974, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of educational access for non-English speaking students in <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, which originated from San Francisco Chinatown. This case set a precedent for students around the country who were immigrants, children of immigrants, or English language learners by opening up the American education system to bilingual education.</p>\n                <p>San Francisco saw a sharp influx of immigrants from non-European and non-white nations with the passing of the Immigration Act of 1965.<sup>1</sup> This also correlated to an influx of students from abroad who were continuing their education at schools in the city, while speaking languages other than English.<sup>2</sup> These students were entering schools at their grade level, but struggling to understand what was being taught because they lacked a solid foundation in the English language. These “English-only” schools were isolating for students coming from immigrant and non-English-speaking backgrounds.<sup>3</sup> In addition, teachers in the district did not feel that they had adequate resources to teach English as a second language alongside the rest of the assigned curriculum and subjects.<sup>4</sup> In an official publication, the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) admitted that these students were “inevitably doomed to be dropouts and become another unemployable in the ghetto.”<sup>5</sup> The district itself recognized the lack of equitable educational resources, and the role that this disparity played in the impoverishment of Chinese families and children in the school district.</p>\n                <p>In 1970, a collective of students, families, and community organizations in Chinatown rallied a class action lawsuit against the SFUSD with the help of Ling-Chi Wang, a UC Berkeley graduate student, and Edward Steinman, a Chinatown attorney.<sup>6</sup> The court case was named for Kinney Kinmon Lau, a first grader at Jean Parker Elementary on the northern edge of Chinatown, and Alan H. Nichols, the SFUSD Board of Education president at the time.<sup>7</sup> The lawsuit was initially denied by the District Court for the Northern District of California and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit before Chinatown community members appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The defendants argued that the school’s lack of resources for students with limited English proficiency constituted educational discrimination. They argued that providing resources for English language learners as well as instruction in students’ primary languages would create a culture in the classroom that maintained and celebrated students’ cultural identity.<sup>8</sup></p>\n                <p>On December 10, 1973, the case was heard at the Supreme Court after being appealed from the lower courts. “Our goal is that we want these students to be taught English and to understand English, so that they can have the type of mastered English which our society requires. The problem now is that they are being taught in a language they do not understand,” said Edward Steinman, representing the plaintiffs.<sup>9</sup> While the Supreme Court seemed preoccupied with the question of whether classes would be taught in Chinese, Steinman framed education access as a larger issue of equity, saying that “the school system might wish to employ Chinese-speaking teachers in a bilingual setting, that is their choice. Our complaint is not with methodology. We’re not asking this Court to get involved in petty illogical questions. Our complaint is that right now, the school system is utilizing no methods <sup>to provide adequate education to students</sup>.”<sup>10</sup> The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of the students, stating that “There is no equality of treatment merely by providing students with the same facilities… for students who do not understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education.”<sup>11</sup></p>\n                <p>After the case passed, the Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA) and the Association of Chinese Teachers helped to train San Francisco teachers in the district to teach bilingual classes.<sup>12</sup> Using <i>Lau v. Nichols</i> as a precedent, subsequent court cases determined that bilingual education was an essential way to create educational equity for non-English speaking students.<sup>13</sup> One such 1974 case, <i>Aspira v. Board of Education of the City of New York</i>, resulted in the creation of a bilingual-bicultural education program for 200,000 Puerto Rican children in New York City.<sup>14</sup> However, many students and marginalized community members found that under the Lau precedent, school districts would evade comprehensive educational equity by only doing the bare minimum to meet legal requirements</p>\n                <p>Despite <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>’ resounding impact, anti-immigrant sentiments have since challenged the presence of bilingual access to education, such as California Proposition 227 which passed in 1998.<sup>15</sup> Prop 227 stated that all ESL instruction must be taught in English, hoping to ban other languages from being spoken in the classroom.<sup>16</sup> That being said, San Francisco districts resisted the proposition using <i>Lau v. Nichols</i> as federal precedent to defend themselves and their bilingual classes in schools.<sup>17</sup> </p>\n                <p> Overall, <i>Lau v. Nichols</i>, which came from the heart of Chinatown’s struggle for educational access, represents a landmark case in bilingual education. This historic court case has opened up educational avenues for countless other non-English speaking immigrants in addition to the Chinese American population.</p>\n            </div>\n           \n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup><i>SFUSD Bilingual Education Lau vs Nichols SFGTV San Francisco</i>, 2007. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXhQrJ37gFE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXhQrJ37gFE</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup>Ibid.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup>Ibid.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>4</sup>Ibid.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>5</sup>Oyez. “Lau v.

Moreover, it is a stereotype that distorts the realities of poverty and discrimination within Asian American communities, rendering invisible the unique institutional barriers that Asian Americans experience.</p>\n                <p>While some Asian Americans are socioeconomically successful, this outcome is not shared across all Asian American communities. When Asian American students are seen as “model minorities,” their struggles are largely ignored in the education system. This is reflected in the lack of targeted and culturally competent resources for Asian American students with limited English proficiency (LEP) and first generation college status. The model minority myth masks the structural causes of education inequality. It erases the unique needs and positionalities of Asian American students, and redirects solutions for educational disparities to individuals rather than institutions. It is thus an important part of understanding how Asian Americans are perceived and treated, as well the role of Asian Americans in a broader U.S. racial context.</p>\n                <p>The model minority myth was popularized in the 1960s, when the New York Times published an article called “Success Story, Japanese-American Style.”<sup>3</sup> The article argued that Japanese Americans were able to achieve socio-economic success due to cultural values, a strong work ethic, and emphasis on education. Since then, Chinese Americans have also been subsumed under the model minority label, primarily due to the influx of Chinese Americans in higher education and STEM fields. In education, Asian Americans are perceived as “academic achievers” with high levels of educational attainment. The media has sensationalized the representation of Chinese Americans in elite and predominantly white institutions, such as the Ivy Leagues. This perception reinforces the model minority myth, framing Asian American students as competing with white students for spots at highly selective universities. However, this does not accurately reflect the reality of many Asian American students who attend community college, either to transfer into four year programs or receive other forms of accreditation. More Asian American students are enrolled in the City College of San Francisco (CCSF) system alone than in all eight Ivy Leagues combined, with over 17,000 Asian American students representing 31.8% of total CCSF enrollment.<sup>4</sup> Elite institutions dominate the conversation about Asian American access to higher education, detracting attention and resources from addressing the educational needs of the many more Asian American students in community college systems.</p>\n                <p>Located in San Francisco’s Chinatown, the CCSF Chinatown/North Beach campus represents an important site for addressing Chinese American educational disparities. Disaggregating ethnic data by language access, for example, reveals that 44.7% of Chinese Americans have limited English proficiency (LEP) compared to 8.5% of Americans as a whole.<sup>5</sup> Due to language barriers and the lack of in-language resources to support Chinese American students with LEP status, many struggle to navigate “monolingual” courses without adequate English as Secondary Language (ESL) programs. CCSF’s Chinatown/North Beach branch has worked to offer ESL classes, which are popular among Chinese immigrants and elderly people living in Chinatown.<sup>6</sup> Across community college systems and higher education institutions more broadly, however, LEP accommodations remain underfunded and underprovided.</p>\n                <p>The model minority myth thus obscures the unique educational barriers faced by Chinese American students. It masks educational disparities as individual problems, comparing under-resourced Chinese American students to their high-performing counterparts. While Chinese Americans come from different backgrounds, the myth suggests that merit is needed to achieve socioeconomic status, rather than institutional support. The model minority myth hypervisibilizes Chinese and Asian Americans as successful minorities, yet invisibilizes the realities of their struggles at the same time. To understand how resource distribution affects Asian American experiences in education, the model minority myth is important to reevaluate and dismantle.</p>\n            </div>\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup> City College of San Francisco. n.d. “Chinatown / North Beach Center 三藩市市立大學華埠北岸區分校.” CCSF.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup> Ng, Jennifer C., Sharon S.

I'm the Education Equity Policy Manager at Chinese for Affirmative Action in San Francisco. <b>CAA is a civil rights organization founded in 1969 out of the Asian American Movement, very much in the legacy of scrappy student-led organizers who wanted to really advance a mission that we still carry today, which is to defend and advance the civil and political rights of Chinese Americans and also advance multi-racial democracy</b>. So this takes form in a lot of different ways. CAA has several issue areas: education, equity, economic justice, civic engagement, language access, and community safety as well as immigrant rights. We have a lot of different touchpoints on doing work and being a progressive voice in and on behalf of Asian American communities. But we are also first and foremost in coalition with other organizations. Whether that's our language access network, or current voting collaborative, we work very closely with other community-based organizations. </p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">My work as an equity policy manager –  I can say a little bit about myself. I'm originally from San Francisco born and raised, came up through the public school system, and a lot of my experiences being the daughter of Chinese immigrants who worked in restaurants, worked in Chinatown bakeries – <b>a lot of those experiences really shaped and informed perspectives that I bring to how we look at equity today and how we look at trying to address systemic barriers, so that more people have more access to sort of life-changing opportunities such as education and training at the kind of like broader advocacy level, but also trying to address people's direct needs.</b></p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">So to that end, <b>CAA also advances advocacy but also has lots of touchpoints around direct services and civic engagement. So trying to inform people about their rights and also, you know, connect them with real opportunities</b>. So whether that's filing for a green card, helping them find work, or to enroll at City College, that's a lot of the direct ties that we have that often translates into policy advocacy.”</p>\n            \n                <p className=\"question\">What is Chinese for Affirmative Action and what is the educational history behind the organization? What does the organization stand for?</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">“<b>Our name in terms of affirmative action actually comes from relation to employment, which a lot of people don't often think about when it's brought up today</b>. But a lot of our advocacy started around making sure that there was access to job opportunities for Chinese Americans. So whether that included things like working as a firefighter or working in the city government or in good construction jobs, trying to make sure that communities, particularly people of color who had been excluded from a lot of these areas of work historically, were able to get a chance to actually have these positions when they were available, particularly when they were local. So, for example, when there was construction in Chinatown going on, we wanted to make sure that the local residents, often Chinese immigrant residents, had a chance to actually benefit from the job opportunities, like economic mobility that was available cause of those projects.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">That's just the approach that we had in our founding history. <b>But another area we were founded around was advancing the legal case Lau v. Nichols in the San Francisco Unified School District. That essentially was also about affirmative action, right?</b> It was the idea that providing education only in English did not actually mean providing meaningful access to education.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>But if it wasn't actually accessible to everyone, then that doesn't make it an actual equal education</b>. That's not enough that you need to provide affirmative opportunities. It's not just about giving everybody the same treatment, but that you need to actually take additional steps to make sure there's meaningful access, whether that's jobs or education or otherwise for different groups. <b>So when we talk about affirmative action it's not just in education, it's also in employment. It's also in public contracting. It's also about language access. It's about making meaningful opportunities for all people, and particularly for people who have been historically excluded.</b>”</p>\n                {/* <img src={require('../../assets/images/cfaa/CAA_1.JPG')}/> */}\n                {/* <br/><br/> */}\n\n                <p className=\"question\">Jumping back in history, since my research is centralized around CCSF and the significance of the Chinatown / North Beach Campus, I especially want to know more about CAA’s advocacy for the building of the campus. What was CAA’s main contribution to this movement and why was it so important to the community?</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">“City College classes that were available in Chinatown or in the area were basically just in whatever buildings that the teachers and the staff could find. So that could be basements of churches, community organizations during off hours, but the main campus for a long time up until the nineties was out of an old elementary school. And the site itself was really run down. There was a lot of issues. Parts of the ceiling were coming down, the desks and the bathrooms were built for children, not for adults. And there was just a lot of need, right? <b>This expanding need for vocational training for ESL classes, citizenship classes and this really rapid conclusion that the facilities that were available in Chinatown were not enough, that they needed to be renovated</b>. So Prop A, at the time, created investment for both San Francisco Unified School District and the college to acquire and build an actual permanent campus.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">And the actual site was the parking lot. It was just a parking lot at the time, and it was really hard to find a place that was not displacing residents. The site was actually secured, but the actual building of the campus was blocked because essentially <b>a lot of business interests, local hotels, and a lot of the politicians that they donated to really came out against the construction of the site. They wanted to – they advanced all kinds of different tactics to try to block the construction. Because it would essentially affect their business interests, whether that was about blocking their 360 panoramic views from the hotel or bringing in traffic – whether that's foot traffic, by train, or by car – people who are not their usual customers</b>.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">However, <b>it was actually an investment into an institution that would serve working people in Chinatown or Chinese Americans, even like Chinese community members across the city would come to a central location, to a state-of-the-art newly built campus that was promising to serve the needs of the Chinese community. So the role of CAA in that was really ramping up and turning out community support, because the only way to essentially turn the tides, against sort of organized political interests that had already essentially bought and had the ears of the politicians who were involved, was to make sure that there was really mass popular support</b>.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">We couldn't meet the needs of community members in a two-story building or something like that. There's actually so many pieces that needed to be addressed. <b>And as it is today, it is really state of the art. There is a full kitchen. There's an auditorium like multiple stories. And it actually is a real cornerstone of what fits into sort of like the Chinese community landscape, especially as a campus.</b>”</p>\n                \n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/cfaa/CAA_2.JPG')}/>\n                <br/><br/>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/cfaa/CAA_3.JPG')}/>\n                <br/><br/>\n\n                <p className=\"question\">Especially demonstrated by the involvement in the Lau v. Nichols Supreme Court decision, one pillar that Chinese for Affirmative Action represents is clearly educational equality. What are some misconceptions about educational inequality and affirmative action? How does CAA work to combat them?</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">“So the first thing that I always do when I talk about affirmative action is I try to contextualize first – for CAA, what's the bigger picture beyond higher education and Affirmative Action? Because there, there's so much more that we need to think about when we're talking about race-conscious policies. We could talk about scholarships, dedicated scholarships for Asian American students, Asian American affiliate groups on campuses, culturally competent mental health counseling for students. There are lots of things that are race conscious and we need race-conscious solutions to issues that are caused by racism. And that there is this need to really talk about this big picture when higher education is this one piece of that.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">All of this is interconnected. Higher education is just one piece of a person's journey for obvious reasons. It's four years or, or maybe more, maybe less. But there are so many other areas that this impacts in terms of actually addressing the misconceptions about affirmative action. That it is the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. It is one part of that, is one tool to address the fact that barriers still have existed historically and still exist. And that it's just one piece of the picture.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>It was very much in addressing the legacies of slavery against Black Americans. The redlining, segregation, the de facto institutional racism that had existed for years after the end of slavery, still have an impact. Simply removing barriers or trying to undo racist policies is not enough. You actually need to proactively open doors and create, whether that is job opportunities or educational opportunities. You need to create pathways for people to actually reach stability and success. So a lot of the history and the bigger picture work, we try to center when we're trying to combat these misconceptions.</b></p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>I think some of the misconceptions are that Asian Americans don't benefit from affirmative action, which is just fundamentally not true. We can look at these historical cases. We can look at real issues that Asian Americans face today. We can talk about the bamboo ceiling. We can talk about the anti-Asian incidences of violence that still occur. There are many ways in which racism against Asian Americans still exists and why in fact, our groups need policies that are race conscious, like affirmative action, in order to address these issues and talk about the nuts and bolts of the Supreme Court cases that are moving forward right now related to affirmative action. In fact, there was no evidence at all that Asian Americans are harmed by affirmative action</b> policies in higher education.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">Big picture grounding is necessary, but we're also here to address the specifics. And there's a lot of like misinformation that is out there. Affirmative action as it is right now in college admissions is more about holistic review, right?

How has it changed specifically for Asian Americans? Has CAA’s positionality shifted as a result?</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">“Over the last few decades a lot of changes are related to population growth and how shifts have happened right after the nineties, when family-based immigration really ramped up. We've seen this like real increased growth in the size and the diversity of what Asian America looks like. So, when we talk about CAA's origins – the sixties and the seventies – I think the experiences of Asian Americans at that time very much focused on different populations than we see today. We've had a lot of fights and advocacy from second generation, often Chinese Americans. So when you think about like City College early kind of fights, right? Like a lot of the advocates were second generation, but amongst the students [we] see this growth of more first generation immigrants who advocate for themselves.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">Not just for the campus, but for the classes that they were in, the ESL classes that they were in. And that has changed. We didn't used to have as many service programs for recent immigrants as we do now. We were thinking in terms of – thinking about where the greatest needs are within the Chinese American community, and that has shifted in terms of like where we see our work. </p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>When you look at the City College of San Francisco, the number of Asian American students that are served at CCSF is more than the number of all Asian American students served by all the schools in the Ivy League. When you think about the scale of this number of students that are served and the impact that it has</b>, we can't just advocate for more spaces or for expanded support for Asian Americans in these really exclusive spaces. We actually have to also think about where the majority of Asian American students are. </p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>The statistic that often shocks people – I think it's like 43%, but almost half of all Asian Americans in higher education are in community college. They're not at elite institution</b>. So institutions like City College don't need affirmative action policies, because they don't reject students generally speaking. <b>If you have truly accessible schools and where you have a truly accessible system, where everybody who wants to access an education can get one, that's a very different picture than saying, “We need affirmative action to try to divvy up limited spots that are competitive for whatever reason.” If you can imagine a community college system that provides education that is top quality, if we really invest in those teachers, those resources, and you're getting a Harvard level education, why can't everyone have something like that? So I would say like that's some of what we've been trying to navigate</b>.</p>\n\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/cfaa/CAA_5.JPG')}/>\n                <br/><br/>\n\n                <p className=\"question\">CAA has participated in intersectional activism, advocating against gender discrimination in the SFPD. Can you speak to the importance of focusing on intersectionality in educational equality, especially in regards to old immigration laws? As CAA is based out of Chinatown, how do you see intersectionality manifest in Chinatown – both through activism and disparity?</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">“To talk a little bit about old immigration law history, <b>the first race-based immigration bans were targeting Chinese immigrants when we look at the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. But that law was actually predated by the Page Act, which specifically targeted Asian women or Chinese women under the assumption that all Chinese women coming to the United States were engaging in some form of illegal activity, or alleging essentially sex work</b>. That there is in the very roots of where a lot of these like racist, discriminatory immigration laws come from. It’s this very deeply both raced and gendered lens. And that really carries through in a lot of ways in what we're seeing today.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">I'll give an example of that that comes to mind since that's related to our most recent work. This is related to more of our community safety work.

And how do we work in collaboration with other groups that have actually already made a headway on this issue?</b> In that trying to address public safety does not does not mean more policing, right? When we see the impacts that increased police presence has in terms of creating harm for Black communities, LGBT communities, we work with groups that have already been advancing this issue for a long time to come up with new solutions.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\"><b>One of the key messaging points that we land on in discussion with other organizations, including Alliance for Girls in California, has been trying to shift the idea that public safety and like issues of street harassment are public health issues – just like in the ways that we can talk about gun violence as a public health issue</b>.</p>\n                <p className=\"answer\">That needs a systemic response.

Like the issue of sexual harassment on university campuses, on bullying, on those kind of issues too, right? Like if we're thinking about like public spaces where these happen most frequently, schools, in addition to like streets, transit, businesses, schools are also a big nexus for where we see a lot of incidents reported too.

As a result, SF Chinatown became one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the country, as well as a bastion of affordable housing for low-income immigrants in an increasingly expensive city. From the 1930s to the present, Chinatown community members have taken it upon themselves to fight against the state for more affordable housing in their neighborhood. This has resulted in a long tradition of organizing that traces from the International Hotel in Manilatown, to Ping Yuen and Mei Lun Yuen, to the continued threat of gentrification to Chinatown today. This fight offers lasting lessons in community organizing and resilience in the face of capitalist interests, not just to preserve access to affordable housing, but to defend the place Chinatown residents call home.</p>\n            </div>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Housing","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport CarouselHeader from '../../components/CarouselHeader'\nimport \"./IHotel.css\";\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst IHotel = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"ihotel-page\">\n            <div className=\"carousel\">\n            <CarouselHeader\n                    items = {[\n                        {\n                            path: 'ihotel-carousel/carousel-1.jpeg',\n                            alt: 'First slide',\n                            label: 'An I-Hotel Tenant Association newspaper',\n                            caption: 'Paunawa Newspaper, October 1970, AAS ARC 2019/2, box 1, folder 2, Save the International Hotel Records, Ethnic Studies Library, UC Berkeley.'\n                        },\n                        {\n                            path: 'ihotel-carousel/carousel-2.jpeg',\n                            alt: 'Second slide',\n                            label: 'A victory song, with lyrics in 3 languages to reflect the Filipino, American, and Chinese participants in the anti-eviction struggle.',\n                            caption: 'Victory song, n.d., AAS ARC 2019/2, box 1, folder 10, Save the International Hotel Records, Ethnic Studies Library, UC Berkeley.

The rebuilt I-Hotel was the focal point of the 1960s and 70s anti-eviction protests<sup>1</sup>.

The residents still worked primarily in the service industry, but also served as political leaders in Manilatown. Most of these residents were elderly, as the I-Hotel was one of few affordable housing options for low-income residents of Manilatown.

The I-Hotel was owned by managing corporation Milton Meyer and Company, whose President and Director, Walter Shorenstein, was a well-established San Francisco real-estate mogul and local politician who believed in the capitalist expansion of the city.<sup>8</sup> In June of 1968, Milton Meyer and Company applied for the demolition of the I-Hotel building, with the intention of turning the property into a parking lot to be used by Financial District employees. The tenants of the I-Hotel did not find out about this plan until that October.<sup>9</sup> Opposition to the destruction was immediate, as San Francisco was already lacking affordable housing in general;<sup>10</sup> there would be no alternative place for elderly Filipinos to live. Later, in 1973, Shorenstein sold the property to the Thailand-based Four Seas Investment Corporation.<sup>11</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/ihotel/I-Hotel_3.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            A sign at a demonstration to protect the I-Hotel.\n                            <br/>Citation: Photograph of a demonstration from an IHTA newspaper, n.d., AAS ARC 2019/2, box 1, folder 2, Save the International Hotel Records, Ethnic Studies Library, UC Berkeley.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>In response to these efforts to demolish the I-Hotel, its tenants began organizing into the United Filipino Association in 1969, which later became the International Hotel Tenants Association (IHTA). The IHTA advocated for the preservation of the I-Hotel as low-income housing and engaged in a variety of protests and legal actions against the Four Seas Investment Corporation, including taking their cause to a public hearing at the City Permit Appeals Board<sup>12</sup>. Many of the tenants were manongs (a term loosely translated as “older brother,” used to refer to the first generation of Filipino American immigrants) who either came from a labor movement or social movement background, or grew into leadership roles during the anti-eviction movement. With their experiences, they brought valuable insight, leadership, and militancy to the movement.<sup>13</sup></p>\n                <p>The I-Hotel movement is also notable in the sense that it was intergenerational, bringing the young and elderly together for a common cause. As the Third World Liberation Front Strikes arose at San Francisco State University and UC Berkeley, Asian American student activists demanded an education that was relevant to Third World people and followed their principle of “Serve the People.” Inspired by the organizing of the older tenants and the IHTA, the I-Hotel became a community hub for the student activists. Meetings and classes were held in the basement of the hotel, and the eviction defense itself was a major rallying point for them to take action to materially improve the circumstances of working-class Asian Americans.<sup>14</sup> While a wide range of Asian American students built ties to the community through the I-Hotel, the most notable student group was Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino (KDP), or the Union of Democratic Filipinos, which worked directly with the tenants to defend the I-Hotel.<sup>15</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/ihotel/I-Hotel_4.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            A feature on the I-Hotel in the KDP newspaper Kalayaan.\n                            <br/>Citation: Kalayaan I-Hotel feature, n.d., Kalayaan, vol 1, no. 1 page 7, Ethnic Studies Library, UC Berkeley.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>\tOver time, the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement spanned a wide range of organizations and communities throughout the Bay Area, including labor unions, faith groups, the anti-war movement, LGBTQ+ activists, and even major San Francisco politicians. As Estella Habal, a student organizer with the KDP at the time, wrote of the I-Hotel struggle, “It was a fight for housing rights versus private-property rights; for a neighborhood’s existence versus extinction and dispersal; and for the extension of  democratic rights to the poor and working class.” In a sense, the I-Hotel became a symbol of resistance and community power against the commercialization of the city at the time, which unified a broad coalition of leftist constituencies in the city under one cause. Consequently, defenders of the I-Hotel did not just seek to prevent evictions; they were driven by a broader vision of community care for the working class residents of Manilatown. For instance, KDP and IHTA activists were inspired by Black Panther initiatives such as providing free lunch programs to children; similarly, the KDP developed a childcare program at the I-Hotel that allowed parents, especially mothers, to remain involved with the cause even after having children. </p>\n                <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/ihotel/I-Hotel_5.jpeg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                            <figcaption>\n                                A demonstration at the I-Hotel. <br/> A chant sheet for demonstrators.

Despite immense pressure to develop on the land the I-Hotel formerly stood on, sustained community activism prevented the progression of commercial development for nearly 30 years.<sup>20</sup> During this time, the demolished lot, with just a hole in the ground remaining, was a symbol of the enduring activism of the I-Hotel coalition. After the eviction, strong outcry from I-Hotel supporters soon pressured the city to establish the International Hotel Block Development Citizens Advisory Committee (IHCAC), a group devoted to advocating for the displaced tenants, and to pass a zoning ordinance that required housing to be developed on the I-Hotel block. According to Linda Wang, chairwoman of the IHCAC, they were motivated because “this was a fight not just for the hotel, but a longstanding fight against Financial District encroachment. The financial district in San Francisco is east of Kearny Street… There were hotels along Kearny Street, <sup>which</sup> housed Filipino families and then Chinese elderly for the most part. Building by building, these spaces would get sold. The financial district was encroaching into Manilatown on Kearny Street, bordering Chinatown. The I-Hotel <sup>was</sup> a last stand.”<sup>21</sup></p>\n                <p>For the following decade, the IHCAC, city of San Francisco, and Four Seas Company negotiated development agreements, with the IHCAC gradually securing more funds for block development from US Department of Housing & Urban Development grants. The IHCAC agreed to a joint development project with St. Mary’s Chinese Schools and Catholic Center with the Chinatown Community Development Center as the housing developer, and in 1998, the Four Seas company sold the I-Hotel site to the Catholic Church. The Manilatown Heritage Foundation was also incorporated into the effort, as it began to search for and bring back former I-Hotel tenants.</p>\n                <p>Finally, in 2005, the new I-Hotel was opened. Today, the I-Hotel continues to provide 104 units of low-income housing and a Manilatown Center with programming to serve its tenants and the Filipino community in San Francisco. The Manilatown Heritage Foundation continues its critical work to preserve the history of the I-Hotel struggle, as well as create opportunities for organizing and community building in the present day.</p>\n                {/* The following is very ugly )-: */}\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                            <div className=\"imgText\">\n                                <figure>\n                                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/ihotel/I-Hotel_9.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                                    <figcaption>\n                                        The I-Hotel today, with the Transamerica Pyramid in the background.\n                                    </figcaption>\n                                </figure>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className=\"imgText\">\n                                <figure>\n                                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/ihotel/I-Hotel_10.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                                    <figcaption>\n                                        The original I-Hotel sign is displayed in the lobby of the <br/>modern-day I-Hotel senior housing building.\n                                    </figcaption>\n                                </figure>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Vivian Kuang, personal photo, March 25, 2023.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Putting the I-Hotel struggle in perspective, it stands out amongst the rich history of Chinatown and San Francisco as a whole as a uniquely intergenerational, pan-Asian, cross-racial, and radical movement for a city that belonged to everyone, regardless of their race or socioeconomic status. Beyond the eviction defense, the movement was at its core fighting for a world in which working class Asian Americans were resourced and empowered. Over 40 years later, the I-Hotel continues to work towards this goal, whether it be through the activists and community organizations that were cultivated in its basement, the networks of solidarity created through the movement, or the living legacy of those continuing to fight for Manilatown and Chinatown.</p>\n            </div>\n            \n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component?

A Chinese social worker in the 1920s lamented, “people say the Chinese live so crowded, but nobody will rent to us,” while a white resident of San Francisco proclaimed “Let the Chinese stay below Stockton. This is a white man’s land.”<sup>1</sup> In 1932, a permanent injunction was issued to bar Chinese people from occupying homes on Nob Hill,  just adjacent to Chinatown.<sup>2</sup> And in 1939, federal officials estimated that almost 90 percent of Chinatown dwelling units were substandard, and that almost 80 percent had no heating or private bathing or cooking facilities.<sup>3</sup> </p>\n                <p>As soon as the San Francisco Housing Authority was established in 1938, community advocates called for more housing. Housing advocate Lim P. Lee, an immigrant from Hong Kong, wrote, “Chinatown can request the proper housing authorities to set up housing in this community for <sup>low income</sup> families.  In view of our congested conditions, this is one of the urgent needs.”<sup>4</sup> Organizations like the Chinese Young Women’s Christian Association also sent letters to the commission asking for a remedy to the overcrowded homes in Chinatown.<sup>5</sup> The Housing Authority moved forward with the Chinatown housing project, CAL 1-5, but nothing was built due to a lack of funding.</p>\n                <p>In 1939, Chinatown housing activists took matters into their own hands and formed the Chinatown Housing Project Committee, composed of various Chinatown service organizations and groups like the Chinese Catholic Center and the Chinese Six Companies. They asserted that a new housing project would not only provide more housing and it might also help  decrease the  high tuberculosis rate in SF Chinatown, which at the time was among the highest in the nation and three times higher than in the rest of the city.<sup>6</sup> Ping Yuen, the new  housing  project, was finally opened in 1951, yielding 234 liveable units.<sup>7</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image1.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img-taller\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Celebration of the Opening of Ping Yuen \n                            <br/>\n                            Citation: University of California, Berkeley, Ethnic Studies Library.

In 1968, 778 families were on the waitlist for an open apartment in Ping Yuen.<sup>8</sup> The 1970 census described 13.4% of Chinatown housing as overcrowded and estimated that a quarter of the population lived in such conditions.<sup>9</sup> </p>\n                <p>Despite the high demand for housing in Ping Yuen, the complex also suffered from rundown conditions and security issues. In July 1977, a gang-related shootout took place in the housing project, leaving a 16 year old resident dead.  Julia La Chica, a Japanese Filipina artist and former resident who grew up in the Ping, recounted in an interview  that the building was wide open, “so anybody could come inside.” This presented  a safety issue, given the building’s proximity to the Red Light District.<sup>10</sup> She also recalled how the elevator was consistently broken and dirty and how the garbage chute was always overflowing.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image2.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Julia La Chica and her Family in their Living Room for their First Christmas in the Ping\n                            <br/>\n                            Citation: Julia la Chica, Personal Phototograph, December 1973\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The death of Julia Wong finally spurred tenants to demand change. Between 1978 and 1979, 200 families participated in a rent strike that lasted months to protest the poor repair and security conditions. The strike was co-organized by future San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, who was a law student at the time.<sup>12</sup> Residents paid their rent into an escrow holding account until their demands for guards, new gates, better lighting, and window bars were met. La Chica recalls that the activists were mostly Chinese women who were “very women-centered,” and that because of the successful organizing of the rent strike, the residents gained more strength and confidence to deal with the other issues in the building.<sup>13</sup></p>\n                <br/>\n                <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image3.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                            <figcaption>\n                                Promise of Strength\n                                <br/>\n                                Citation: Julia la Chica, 2023\n                            </figcaption>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image4.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                            <figcaption>\n                                Ping Yuen Entrance Today\n                                <br/>\n                                Citation: Maddi Wong, Personal Photograph, March 2023\n                            </figcaption>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image5.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                            <figcaption>\n                                Ping Yuen Exterior Today\n                                <br/>\n                                Citation: Maddi Wong, Personal Photograph, March 2023\n                            </figcaption>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p>However, by the 2000s, as a result of chronic underfunding, the city of San Francisco again failed to address security concerns and renew aging infrastructure. Robberies and assaults were still common around Ping Yuen.<sup>14</sup> Finally, in 2013, the late Mayor Ed Lee replaced the housing authority commissioners and offloaded public housing properties, including Ping Yuen, to nonprofits better suited to manage housing renovations. The CCDC was able to leverage housing tax credits and EBT financing from the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) to finally work together with tenants to fix the gates and to find temporary housing for tenants while the units were being upgraded.<sup>15</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image6.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Caption: Peace Garden Stay\n                            <br/>Citation: Julia la Chica, 2023\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <p>Reflecting on her experience growing up in Ping Yuen, La Chica expressed that the Ping is important because it is “low income housing for families, the elderly, and youths that would not [otherwise] be able to afford to live in San Francisco.”<sup>16</sup> She expressed concern about the current scarcity of public housing in Chinatown and is now working on a series of art pieces titled “Everybody Deserves a Place to Rest.” The series deals with her experience of  growing up in the Ping, her general  concerns around the homelessness crisis, and her belief that “ people, human beings, [deserve] a place to lay down their heads.”<sup>17</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/pingyuen/image7.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The Ping\n                            <br/>Citation: Julia La Chica, 2019, North Ping Yuen, S.F.

In 1970, a study by the City of San Francisco found that over 26% of Chinatown's population lived in overcrowded conditions. In 1974, the Bureau of Building Inspection found that 42% of housing in Chinatown contained building code violations. Additionally, around 1976, the San Francisco Planning Department found that 50% of Chinatown’s elderly population lived without sufficient plumbing.<sup>1</sup> Clearly, Chinatown desperately needed housing that would provide its residents, especially its elderly residents,  with safe, secure, and affordable places to live. One solution to this issue was the Mei Lun Yuen Redevelopment Project.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/meilunyuen/image1.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Up until the 1970s, the southwest block of Stockton and Sacramento Streets contained 11 residential buildings that were in poor condition, with some even remaining unoccupied. The Chinatown Coalition for Better Housing proposed the Mei Lun Yuen Redevelopment Project, which would redevelop the block into low-income housing instead.<sup>2</sup> The location was ideal, as it was within a block of other important Chinatown resources and locations, including the Cameron House, St. Mary’s Chinese School, Stockton Elementary School, and the YMCA.<sup>3</sup> The original plan was to construct five residential buildings containing 175 units in total, with 140 units being designated for elderly residents and 35 units designed to accommodate families. There would also be a five-story commercial garage constructed on the property for use by both Mei Lun residents and patrons of the surrounding neighborhood.<sup>4</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/meilunyuen/image2.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The first obstacle in the construction of Mei Lun Yuen was funding. Due to supposed budget cuts, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was unable to provide federal matching funds to construct the project. Community members decided to draw attention to the project’s need for funding by holding a community demonstration. A peaceful walking protest was held from Portsmouth Square, an important community gathering space in Chinatown, to the HUD office in Embarcadero Center. About  200 people came together to show their support for the project. Eventually, the HUD allocated funds specifically for housing subsidy programs. Additionally, funding for the project was acquired through partnerships between multiple developers. The Presbyterian Church in Chinatown partnered with the private developing firm Arcon to develop the project; the church financed the housing while the firm financed the parking garage.<sup>5</sup> Ultimately, the project was able to obtain funding for construction to commence.</p>\n                <p>The other obstacle to Mei Lun Yuen’s construction came from Nob Hill residents who objected to the development. The Nob Hill Association and 840 Powell Street Homeowners Association attempted to sue the HUD for increased traffic, pollution, and blocking their view of the San Francisco Bay.<sup>6</sup> However, the HUD’s environmental impact investigation found that such effects from the project were not significant enough to prevent construction. Measures were taken to reduce the amount of air pollution emitted from the parking garage. For instance, the exhaust pipes from the garage were designed to lay above street level.<sup>7</sup> Additionally, Mei Lun Yuen apartment buildings were designed to intentionally avoid blocking significant portions of the Bay from view. Of the 840 Powell Street apartments, only 19 units would have their view of the Bay partially blocked by the Mei Lun Yuen apartments, while no units would be completely blocked.<sup>8</sup> In the end, the Mei Lun Yuen Redevelopment Project was permitted, and in 1979 construction of the apartments began.<sup>9</sup></p>\n                <p>When Mei Lun Yuen’s construction was completed in 1982, it became the first housing project specifically dedicated to senior housing in San Francisco Chinatown.<sup>10</sup> Today, it remains under the HUD affordable housing program. The apartment complex has a total of 185 residential units, with 152 units designated for elderly residents and 33 units designated for families.<sup>11</sup></p>\n                <br/>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup> United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, San Francisco Area Office, “Mei Lun Yuen Development of the Chinatown Redevelopment Area in San Francisco, California: Draft Environmental Impact Statement” (San Francisco, CA, 1976), 52. http://archive.org/details/meilunyuendevelo2719unit.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup> Li, Chuo. “Postwar Urban Redevelopment and the Politics of Exclusion: The Case of San Francisco’s Chinatown.” Journal of Planning History 18, no. 1 (2019), 37.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup> US HUD, “Mei Lun Yuen Development of the Chinatown Redevelopment Area”, 19.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>4</sup> US HUD, “Mei Lun Yuen Development of the Chinatown Redevelopment Area”, 13.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>5</sup> Li. “Postwar Urban Redevelopment and the Politics of Exclusion,” 37.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>6</sup> Li. “Postwar Urban Redevelopment and the Politics of Exclusion,” 37.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>7</sup> US HUD, “Mei Lun Yuen Development of the Chinatown Redevelopment Area”, 41.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>8</sup> US HUD, “Mei Lun Yuen Development of the Chinatown Redevelopment Area”, 139.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>9</sup> Li. “Postwar Urban Redevelopment and the Politics of Exclusion,” 38.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>10</sup> Li. “Postwar Urban Redevelopment and the Politics of Exclusion,” 38.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>11</sup> “Mei Lun Yuen,” The John Stewart Company, accessed March 14, 2023, https://jsco.net/property/mei-lun-yuen/.\n                    </li> \n                </ul>\n            </details>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default MeiLunYuen;","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport \"./HousingToday.css\";\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst HousingToday = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"housing-today-page\">\n            <div className=\"housing-today-intro\">\n                <br/>\n                <h2>Housing and Community Organizing in Chinatown Today</h2>\n                <p>Today, Chinatown continues to grapple with housing affordability, especially for its low-income and elderly residents. The median household income in Chinatown is $21,000 compared to $88,000 in San Francisco as a whole, and 26% of its population is over 65 years old, compared to 14% in the city overall.<sup>1</sup> Ping Yuen, Mei Lun Yuen, and the I-Hotel remain cornerstones in the neighborhood’s affordable housing landscape. Notably, Chinatown’s housing market is defined by Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units; its 15,000 SROs constitute the majority of housing stock in the neighborhood. SROs serve as a crucial source of affordable housing, especially for elderly residents and new Chinese immigrants to the city. Increasingly, because of skyrocketing housing costs throughout the city, entire families would live in SROs that were meant for fewer occupants. An increasing number of SRO buildings have also been put on sale in recent years by descendants of families who owned SROs. While in some cases the buildings have been converted to nonprofit ownership by community organizations, private investors may buy the properties and subsequently raise rents, risking the elimination of one of the last affordable housing options in the city.<sup>2</sup></p>\n                <p> However, the robust culture of community organizations and activists groups remains. Notably, the Chinatown Community Development Center (CCDC), which has its roots in the I-Hotel eviction struggle, has evolved into a leading community development organization with a portfolio of units accommodating over 4,500 low-income families and seniors.<sup>3</sup> The Chinese Progressive Association, founded in 1972, engages in extensive tenant and worker organizing, and continues Chinatown’s tradition of youth activism through its Youth MOJO (Movement for Justice and Organizing) leadership development program for low-income Chinese American youth.<sup>4</sup></p>\n                <p> As for the I-Hotel, since its reopening in 2005, it has served as a crucial source of housing for low-income elderly people in Chinatown, and the Manilatown Heritage Foundation continues to serve the community by providing community space and holding cultural events like jazz and dance nights, Ilocano language classes, and art exhibits. The Manilatown Heritage Foundation’s space at the I-Hotel also houses art and photographs from the I-Hotel struggle, as well as pieces of the original I-Hotel walls obtained after demolition. Their goal is to support the Filipino community in San Francisco and preserve the history of Manilatown for future generations.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/housingtoday/image1.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/housingtoday/image2.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The history of the I-Hotel struggle lives on in one original tenant who has since returned to live at the I-Hotel. Jeanette Lazam, 74, spoke with us during our visit to the I-Hotel. Jeanette Lazam was a community worker and organizer in Manilatown when she first became involved with the I-Hotel. She went on to join the KDP and later moved into the I-Hotel to work more closely with the tenants to resist the eviction. Reflecting on her experience during the anti-eviction struggle, she noted that it demonstrated the importance of unity in social movements, as well as how to engage people in social and political issues in an accessible, inclusive way. She explained that activists were most successful in mobilizing and educating tenants when they did so in an easy-to-understand, pragmatic manner that resonated with tenants’ day-to-day concerns. “You take people where they're at, not where you think they're at, [or] where you want them to be,” she said. “You cannot substitute your reality for theirs.”<sup>5</sup></p>\n                <p>For instance, Lazam spoke of one tenant she was particularly close to: manong Wahat Tampao. At first, she described Tampao as someone who “could not be bothered” about the eviction. However, after gradually building their relationship and raising his political consciousness around  the class-based dimension of the eviction struggle, Lazam said, “he was the most outspoken proponent of stopping the eviction, [and] by the close of the struggle, he had a clear understanding of the situation as a struggle for “housing for low-income people.” Lazam and Tampao became extremely close, and they walked out of the I-Hotel together on eviction morning. “That's the kind of relationship you need if you're going to do community organizing,” Lazam said. “You have to know the people, and you have to work with them on a day to day level, and you take them where they're at. And then you slowly, consciously, methodically build their strength, build their political consciousness.”</p>\n                <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/housingtoday/image3.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/housingtoday/image4.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>For many years after the eviction, Lazam stayed away from the I-Hotel. The emotions associated with the site were  too overwhelming. Eventually, however, after moving back to the Bay Area and overcoming health issues, Lazam was offered a spot in the new I-Hotel due to her status as a former tenant. Without other feasible affordable housing options, she moved back to the I-Hotel in 2018. Now, having become a community elder, a <i>manang</i>, and an artist, she continues to be involved with the Manilatown Heritage Foundation.</p>\n                <p>For Lazem, returning to the hotel has not been without difficulties. When she stepped foot into the hotel for the first time in decades, she “thought [other former tenants]  were going to be there.” She explained, “And that's why it's been really hard for me to return, because they're not here. And I miss them … There’s not a day that [goes] by that I don't think about them, that I don't hear their voices, that I don't hear their laughter and [remember] how they treated me.”</p>\n                <p>“It’s beautiful,” Lazam said of the modern-day I-Hotel. However, as the last living original tenant, she wished that it could have been rebuilt in time for other original tenants to return home. “They could’ve spent their last days back in their home. And it could have been another community again… Because that's the way they were … But by the time this building was built and people started to move in, [the original tenants] were already gone. And so, they're here [in] spirit.  I just wish their bodies would have been here.”</p>\n                <p>Looking forward, Lazam expressed hope that the Filipino community in San Francisco would continue to grow, and that Manilatown would come to flourish again. “I hope that more Filipinos move in here. Because it is Manilatown. And it's important that this part of San Francisco maintain itself. And the only way it maintains itself is not by signs alone that say Maniltown. It's backed up by a community of people that live and even work here in this city. That's what I want. It's kind of like what Wahat said: ‘housing for low income people.’”</p>\n            </div>\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup>Jason Xu. “San Francisco Chinatown Neighborhood Health Conditions and Status,” San Francisco Department of Public Health, August 20, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.sfdph.org/dph/hc/HCAgen/2019/August%2020/FINAL_Health%20Commission%20Chinatown.pdf\">https://www.sfdph.org/dph/hc/HCAgen/2019/August%2020/FINAL_Health%20Commission%20Chinatown.pdf</a>.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup> J.K.

Opposing U.S. intervention in the Korean/Vietnam War, Asian American organizers saw themselves aligned with those fighting for freedom from imperialism in Asia, articulating American state violence as their common enemy.<sup>4</sup> The Filipino manongs spending summers in the Central Valley to harvest crops and winters in Seattle shucking oysters fought the same system that the KDP peasant organizers in Mindanao fought.  Maoism’s influence stretched from China to San Francisco Chinatown, where it helped to shape the attitudes of the International Hotel liberation struggle.<sup>5</sup>  Now, with the dialogue of mainstream Asian American activism shifted from liberation to representation and security, it’s worth questioning why conditions of community safety today revolve largely around policing.</p>\n                <p>When discussing the International Hotel, activists’ memories of the police are rarely fond. Even before the resistance movement started, police violence was a weapon utilized by white predators in the Chinatown area. Harvey Dong, a UC Berkeley professor of ethnic studies and former owner of Everybody’s Bookstore in the International Hotel, recalled:</p>\n                <p className=\"callout\">A Chinese man that I knew, who was aware of [a white man’s history of sexually harassing children]...tried to stop that child molester from harassing a little girl. And the police were called on [the Chinese man], and the police went to arrest him. I saw that and I explained to the cops what was going on, and they arrested me, also. And the person that was being accused of molestation got away.<sup>6</sup></p>\n                <p>Dong’s story reveals the success of racial profiling against Asian Americans.  He elaborated on the story, saying, “I think [the police believed him] because he was a white man.”<sup>7</sup> Further, Dong’s recollection demonstrates a lack of investment in community safety by the police, and how police instead prioritize property and the maintenance of racial apartheid. . Situations like this weren’t uncommon, either. In 1975, in New York Chinatown, 27-year-old Peter Yew was beaten to death by police for attempting to intervene in their assault on a 15-year-old at a traffic stop.<sup>8</sup>  Beyond physical assaults, police were recorded holding unwarranted raids on business and legal aid groups.<sup>9</sup> The Red Guard Party, a Chinese American youth organization, wrote in 1971, “The people of Chinatown want an end to their colonization and exploitation. The people of Chinatown want the freedom to determine their own destinies. The people of Chinatown want an immediate end to police brutality and harassment.”<sup>10</sup></p>\n                <p>As the struggle progressed, community members only became more vulnerable to police violence as they repeatedly resisted eviction at the I-Hotel.  Police horses were brought to the picket line to intimidate protestors, and they did so successfully.  Estella Habal, an activist who was inside the building during the final eviction of tenants on August 4, 1977, described the horses as “terrifying” and the police as “look[ing] like monsters.”<sup>11</sup>  Photographs of the picket line depict a scene which echoes this sentiment.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/reimaginingcommunity/image1.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Robert Hsiang, “Cops and horses surge in front of the I-Hotel, August 4, 1977.”\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Heavily armed police officers arrived in droves, ready and able to cause serious harm to tenants and protesters that they encountered. Pam Lee, an activist at the eviction, described, “Human flesh, however determined, is no barrier to hooves and riot sticks. The police were out for blood.”<sup>12</sup> The <i>Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino Newspaper</i><sup>13</sup> reported that</p>\n                <p className=\"callout\">First using horses, the police urged the frightened beasts into the crowd and proceeded to use their batons to bash heads in a futile effort to form a corridor to the door.  The second charge were police on foot who brutally and indiscriminately started hitting people.<sup>14</sup></p>\n                <p> Seventeen protestors were injured by the police over the course of the eviction; five of those were hospitalized.<sup>15</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/reimaginingcommunity/image2.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Chris Huie, “Melee on Kearny Street in front of I-Hotel, August 4, 1977.”\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The eviction, carried out by 400 police officers, was led by Sheriff Richard Hongisto, who had previously been incarcerated for five days after refusing to evict the I-Hotel tenants.  Hongisto, who led the eviction, described it as “one of the most distasteful things I have had to do since I've been in office.”<sup>16</sup> The leader of the Sheriff’s department being unable to prevent these evictions from happening, despite a seeming investment in allowing tenants to continue to live in the building, demonstrates policing’s investment in capital above all else; the drive to protect property and wealth maintains a grip so iron on law enforcement that even police leadership lacked the authority to put a stop to the evictions.  </p>\n                <p>When evaluating moments in which police did demonstrate an investment in Asian American communities, the most prominent examples still reveal the prioritization of property over life—which is how American policing was designed.<sup>17</sup>  As some Asian Americans have been granted increasing access to social mobility in the near-fifty years following the International Hotel struggle, the bonds of solidarity with other marginalized groups—particularly Black Americans—have weakened.<sup>18</sup> </p>\n                <p>Fundamentally, this redirects back to the “model minority myth,” not in how it oppresses Asian Americans, but in how it protects them. Proximity to whiteness, made possible by distance from Blackness, has often acted as a shield against police violence. But this proximity isn’t enough to keep Asian Americans safe. In 2020, Asian teenager Christian Hall dialed 911 as he was attempting suicide; rather than intervene for his safety, Pennsylvania State Police shot and killed him after mistaking his airsoft pellet gun for a lethal weapon.  In 2021, police ruled that the murder was justified.<sup>19</sup> Also in 2020, a Filipino man named Angelo Quinto in Antioch died after having his neck knelt on by a police officer. The district declined to charge the officer.<sup>20</sup> </p>\n                <p>It’s apparent that there is a need to improve community safety, but it is equally clear that police are unable to provide it. Instead, Asian American scholars and activists have pointed to community-based safety as an effective and viable alternative.  Scholars have identified preventative practices as the most effective measures of reducing crime—both when they reduce risk factors for crime and shield vulnerable victims.  Providing housing for vulnerable community members—those who are low-income, or elderly—decreases their exposure to potential violence.  Furthermore, housing demonstrably decreases instances of theft, robbery, trespassing, loitering, and prostitution, some of the primary low-level offenses that result in incarceration.<sup>21</sup> Activists, in turn, have launched movements to expand access to affordable housing, including through the mission of today’s revival of the International Hotel.</p>\n                <p>Community safety comes down to investment in human life, not property or capital.  Police, by design, are a capitalist tool to protect private property; capitalism is the base of class difference that serves as a criminal risk factor in so many circumstances.<sup>22</sup>  Instead of funding the acquisition of tanks or equipment that costs $1,800 per officer,<sup>23</sup> that money could be reinvested into schools, housing projects, social services, and accessible healthcare—some of the things provided by the International Hotel, which police were instrumental in destroying.  In 1977, an editorial in <i>Ang Katipunan</i> bluntly reminded readers that “when it came down to a choice between buying housing or buying cops, the ‘City That Knows How’ bought cops.”<sup>24</sup> If the struggle for the International Hotel has demonstrated anything, it’s that safety is community constructed and community defended; it cannot be found in state violence.</p>\n            </div>\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup> Dewi Zarni, “A Wave of Racial Violence: A Case Study on The Role of Crime Narratives in Oakland Chinatown,” pp. 3 (2021).\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup> Mayor Libby Schaaf joins with Oakland Chinatown Chamber, OPD, and community to address recent crime in the area,” video file, 40:57, periscope, posted by Libby Schaaf, February 3, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/LibbySchaaf/1lDxLpmkwPkxm\">https://www.pscp.tv/LibbySchaaf/1lDxLpmkwPkxm</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup> “Armed Patrol Security Guards for Oakland Chinatown,” organized by Joanna Au, accessed April 13, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/securityforoaklandchinatown\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/securityforoaklandchinatown</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>4</sup>It’s worth noting that militarized policing in the United States began in Berkeley, California, with August Vollmer, who sought to implement the techniques he learned while fighting in the Philippine-American War.

Faced with discrimination and prejudice outside the boundaries of Kearny, Powell, California, & Broadway, residents of Chinatown created for themselves a self-sustaining community, with everything from the likes of culturally-appropriate groceries to Chinese theaters and herb shops. Of great significance is Chinatown’s long list of cultural enterprises — with a vibrant history of arts, entertainment, and culture, Chinatown has been home to many notable places and events, like the iconic Golden Age nightclubs Kubla Khan and Forbidden City, the Golden Dragon Massacre, the long-standing community arts institution Kearny St. Workshop, and now, a new generation of high-end restaurants, like the Michelin star-earning Mister Jiu’s. These pieces of history have all been a part of forming the social fabric of Chinatown, and continue to shape Chinese American identities, community, and culture. Groups like the Grant Ave. Follies carry on the legacy of the Golden Age of Chinese Nightclubs, while artistic and cultural hotspots like the Kearny St. Workshop and Mister Jiu’s take charge of what it means to be Asian American. These are only some examples of the ways culture thrives in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Through art, community, and innovation, San Francisco’s Chinatown continues to be a beacon of Chinese diasporic culture in the United States and beyond. </p>\n            </div>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Culture","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport \"./GoldenDragon.css\";\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst GoldenDragon = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"housing-today-page\">\n            <div className=\"housing-today-intro\">\n                <br/>\n                <h2>Golden Dragon Massacre and Organized Crime in 70s Chinatown</h2>\n                <div className=\"imgRow\">\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/goldendragon/image3.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                            <figcaption><sup>1</sup></figcaption>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                        <figure>\n                            <img src={require('../../assets/images/goldendragon/image1.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        </figure>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <p>The Golden Dragon Restaurant, today’s Imperial Palace Restaurant, was located at 822 Washington Street, in the heart of Chinatown. Retaining Chinese architectural elegance, the restaurant has been a must-see landmark for tourists. Moreover, the name “金龍” denotes a blessing for the prosperity of the community. However, the massacre that occurred at the restaurant on September 4, 1977 not only shocked the Chinatown community, but also represented one of the most notorious incidents of gang violence citywide. The massacre left five innocent bystanders dead, most of whom were young students. The Golden Dragon Restaurant closed down in January 2006 and reopened a few months later with a new name, Imperial Palace Restaurant, under a different ownership. The Imperial Palace Restaurant is still running today.<sup>2</sup></p>\n                <p>The Golden Dragon Massacre was largely the consequence of long-standing conflicts between two groups of youth: American-born Chinese and foreign-born immigrants predominantly from Hong Kong.<sup>3</sup> The two rival gangs involved in the Golden Dragon case were the Joe Fong Boys and the Wah Chings. The Joe Boys, representing predominantly Hong Kong-born immigrants, were founded in the 1960s and called themselves Chung Ching Yee after “Water Margin,” one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. The gang was based in the Richmond and Sunset District in western San Francisco after splintering off from the Wah Ching. The Wah Ching, meanwhile, was initially established by Chinese Americans during the mid-1960s, and operated illegal gambling houses, brothels, extortion rackets, and loan-sharking operations in Southern California. Multiple factors, such as ideologies and personal affairs, complicated the motives behind the conflicts. According to Mimi Chin, the root cause leading to the prevalence of gangs in the Chinatown community during the 60s and 70s was new young immigrants’ struggle with identity and belonging, along with widespread unemployment.<sup>4</sup></p>\n                <p>The trigger for the mass shooting at the Golden Dragon was a shootout that occurred a few months earlier in July. Due to a dispute over fireworks sales, Wah Ching members shot and killed a Joe Boy member called Felix Huey in Chinatown's Ping Yuen housing project. As retaliation, Joe Boy members planned a shooting in the Golden Dragon Restaurant, which was allegedly frequented by Wah Ching folks. Despite the fact that Wah Ching members were not harmed at all in the massacre, two suspected Wah Ching gunmen killed two members of the Joe Boys in the wake of the massacre on September 11th.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/goldendragon/image4.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption><sup>5</sup></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>In the wake of the incident, the SF Police formed the Chinatown Gang Task Force that resulted in many arrests and convictions of gang members. It was also uncovered that many of the gang members were an integral part of the Hop Sing Tong, a family association. The FBI got involved and infiltrated the Tongs focusing on Raymond “Shrimp Boy” Chow, who had connections with international crime syndicates called triads (Fong). However, the police faced difficulty in their investigation because Chinatown locals were afraid of gang reprisals for their release of information, which Police Chief Charles Gain criticized as the “subculture of fear\" that haunted the community.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/goldendragon/image2.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption><sup>6</sup></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>According to Paul Fong, the leaders of the Chinatown community responded to the massacre by working with community organizations to help stem the conditions that promote gang affiliation and gang violence. Organizations included the Chinatown Youth Center (CYC), Chinatown Community Development Center (CCDC), and Cameron House programs. Later, CYC morphed into a citywide program focusing on violence prevention in and  beyond the Chinatown borders. Given the broad scope of organized crime, local police and the FBI were beyond the resources of local agencies, instead requiring involvement from local police and the FBI.</p>\n                <p>In the era of the Golden Dragon Massacre, from 1969 to 1977, 44 people were murdered in gang violence in SF Chinatown alone. Today, gang activities in Chinatown have been dormant for four decades, and the era of organized crime has passed, though white-collar crimes and drug dealing still occur.

The mission of KSW is to produce and promote art that empowers Asian Pacific American artists and communities.[1] The nonprofit organization was founded in 1972, during the peak of the Asian American cultural movement, as a grassroots arts collective located on the edge of San Francisco Chinatown.</p>\n                <p>KSW is deeply tied to the history of Asian American social and political movements in the 20th century. In fact, its origins are inextricably linked with the fight to save the International Hotel, which fought for the rights of elderly Asian tenants. KSW started something not seen by Asian American artists before: community organizing through art. The organization was founded by artists Jim Dong, Lora Jo Foo, and Michael Chin, all of whom were involved in local community organizing efforts at the time.[2] Their grassroots activities, such as creating silk screened posters for the I-Hotel protests, attracted new artists including Nancy Hom, a multimedia artist originally from New York City, who would eventually become KSW’s Executive Director from 1995 to 2003.</p>\n                <p className='callout'>“Everything was forming then so it was really exciting to be part of that movement… the I-Hotel was part of wanting to connect with Asian Americans… -I knew about fighting for homes for seniors who looked like my grandparents and we were all sort of part of the same struggle… we visited the I-Hotel and, lo and behold, there was a workshop on the ground floor, and it was Kearny Street Workshop…and I kind of wanted to be part of that.” <br/> - Nancy Hom, interview on March 23, 2023 </p>\n                <p>Since its origin, KSW has supported artists whose work has been influenced by the challenges and celebrations of their communities. KSW operated on the ground floor of the I-Hotel alongside other community organizations, and worked closely with organizations such as the nearby Chinese Cultural Center. Their members were often at the center of Chinatown organizing, including protests for affordable housing and labor rights. KSW artists documented their experiences and helped disseminate information about protests via posters and newsletters. They also taught classes to individuals who were brought together under the common purpose to use their art to serve their community. As Nancy Hom recalls, <i>“There was something offered by Kearny Street Workshop on a daily basis.”</i></p>\n                <p>1974 was a turning point for Kearny Street Workshop. Acquiring the space formerly known as the Jackson Street Gallery gave the organization enough space for performances and two floors of exhibits, which enabled them to explore different artistic outlets such as curated exhibitions, music and dance performances, and theater.</p>\n                <p>KSW was initially founded as the only space where Chinatown and Manilatown youth could gather and explore arts programming, but eventually opened their resources to artists of all ages as more platforms emerged for young artists. KSW was part of a movement that pushed the boundaries of Asian American art and culture through mediums including (though not limited to) jazz, small press publications, silkscreen posters, and public murals.</p>\n                <p>Today, KSW provides a platform for Asian and Pacific Islander artists to show their work and foster a network through classes, workshops, exhibitions, performances, screenings, and other programming. In its 50 years of operation, it has helped to launch thousands of API artists including Ali Wong, Hasan Minhaj, and Hellen Jo.[3][4] As pioneers in showcasing API arts, they were the first to present an exhibition on the Angel Island detention barracks, to publish Filipino American poetry, and to organize an Asian American jazz festival.[5]</p>\n                <p>Their organizing principles include: Solidarity, Renewal, Futurity, and Autonomy. Through these principles they hope to amplify APA voices, whether related to contemporary issues or lesser known histories.</p>\n                <p>KSW’s programming has evolved alongside its community. What has remained consistent is the organization’s resolve to increase Asian American representation, not only in the arts sector but also in the broader sociopolitical landscape of the United States.</p>\n                <Carousel className=\"kearny-carousel\">\n                    <Carousel.Item>\n                        <img className=\"d-block w-100\"

After opening his first nightclub, the Dragon’s Lair, and witnessing a post WWI entertainment boom, Pond continued to grow his commercial interests by opening the Kubla Khan.

Pond was known to have danced and performed alongside his hired entertainers. The nightclub, widely advertised as San Francisco’s “most exciting” theater restaurant, attracted many aspiring Asian American artists who were raised on or influenced by American music and cinema.<sup>2</sup> Despite their aspirations to work as entertainers, Asian Americans artists faced work discrimination in the mainstream American entertainment industry due to negative racial perceptions. As a result, Asian American performers often found their way to San Francisco Chinatown, after finding little success in Hollywood. In Chinatown, they became the stars of the show: entertainers were dubbed “the Chinese Frank Sinatra” (Larry Ching) or “the Chinese Sophie Tucker” (Toy Yat Mar).<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup>Through vaudeville and burlesque performance, the performers were able to find artistic expression at Kubla Khan, paving the way forward for the future of Asian American entertainment.</p>\n                </div>\n                <br/><br/>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/kublakhan/KK_2.jpg')} />\n                    <figcaption>\n                    Eddie Pond Pulls Jadin Wong in a Chinese-Style Cart\n                    <br/>Courtesy of Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA). \n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br/><br/>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/kublakhan/KK_3.jpg')} />\n                    <figcaption>\n                    Three women and four men in military uniform raise their glasses\n                    <br/>Courtesy of Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA). \n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br /><br />\n                <p>Situated at 414 Grant Avenue, Kubla Khan was physically on the border of San Francisco’s Chinatown, edging towards the much “safer” Financial District. Consequently, the nightclub served as a middle ground between the “foreign land” of Chinatown and the predominantly white neighborhoods of San Francisco, and reflected its complex relationship with whiteness. At the nightclub, Chinese Americans were able to find employment that differed from the rest of the community, no longer forced into box-mold jobs like cooks or launderers. However, while Kubla Khan provided a sense of freedom with new opportunities for its entertainers and staff, the nightclub also profited off of harmful stereotypes of Asian Americans, playing up caricaturistic characterizations of the exotic Chinese to appeal to the white gaze. While Kubla Khan and other nightclubs of the time may have exploited these visions of exoticism, they were also extremely innovative, and revolutionized the way that mainstream America viewed Chinese Americans.</p>\n                <p>A predominant example of this innovation was the emergence of an extremely popular dish—chop suey. This was a Cantonese inspired dish which consisted of “…boned chicken, white mushrooms, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, vegetables, bean sprouts, with sesame and Chef's Special Sauce.”<sup>5</sup> While Kubla Khan sold both Chinese and American entrees, chop suey was extremely popular due to its novelty and palatability to Western tastes. The creation of chop suey accurately represents a new culture that was forming during the Golden Age of Chinese Nightclubs—a culture that was not Chinese and not American, but uniquely Chinese-American.</p>\n                <p>Not much is known about the end of the Kubla Khan, except that it went bankrupt and abruptly closed its doors in 1950. Pond’s business partner, Gim Suey Chong, sold his share of the club that same year.<sup>6</sup> According to family accounts, Eddie Pond stayed involved in the Chinatown community by participating in parades and opening various businesses, including a jewelry store.

It has influenced the perception of what the culture of Chinatown is through the new attention they are getting because of the new surgance of nightlife. Nightlife changed the way community members could keep in touch with each other, changing the ideas of what it means to eat and exist in Chinatown.</p>\n                <p>The population of Chinatown was practically exiled by most of San Francisco, and especially the food. Only 5 restaurants were listed on the businesses directory in 1856 out of the 88 Chinese businesses in San Francisco. Most of the food that was made within the restaurants were catered towards the traditional taste of Chinese cuisine, but with struggles came almost a compromise. Chop Suey first came up as the idea of putting all their sides together and mixing them up during the Gold Rush, but later on becomes capitalized during the era of Nightlife in San Francisco. The following years Chop Suey rises as one of the first mainstream transnational dishes that comes out the United States(Liu)<sup>1</sup>. The idea of chop Suey, was purely an American idea while there were ideas that were inspired by Chinese cuisine. It became a popular food throughout the US that there were different styles of chop Suey by the city that they were advertising in(Liu)<sup>2</sup>. However, the idea of what it meant to be Chinese was still struggling to be understood in San Francisco. \"In 1905, San Francisco had only forty‐six Chinese restaurants. Twenty years later, the number grew to seventy‐ eight, which was still far behind that of New York.\", but that did not mean that would not change through the years.</p>\n                <p>After the 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco, a new vision of Chinatown emerged. The idea of who the  restaurants should be marketed towards rapidly changed with the urgent need of money. They targeted their design and taste of their food to appease the western side of San Francisco. During the 1940s, transliteration and western names were popular within the new scene of restaurants to gain the attention of the outside clientele of Chinatown(Chao)<sup>3</sup>. This still shows in the restaurants today. The era of Night Clubs gave way to this idea in some way, another way to make an economic boom(Chao)<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n                <p>Chinatown’s cuisine was initially seen as foreign and unusual to the Americanized gaze—the boom of chop suey and other dishes, nightclubs like Kubla Khan helped redefine the experience of eating in Chinatown<sup>5</sup>. It changed the ideas of what it meant to be in Chinatown, and the perception of the people who resided in Chinatown. It gave the new generation of Chinatown a chance to discover themselves in different ways while exploring the expanse of what it means to be Chinese American, especially with the idea of what it means to eat Chinese. Chinese food evolved from being a comfort food just for the Chinese people who lived in the States, to a normalized eating option for the American public.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/culturefood/image1.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            People eating at Kubla Khan enjoying the entertainment in front of them\n                            <br/>\n                            <a href=\"https://asamnews.com/2019/10/24/the-kubla-khan-at-the-gateway-of-san-francisco-chinatown/\">BY AKEMI TAMANAHA OCTOBER 24, 2019</a>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <p>Dining and entertainment became two sides of the same coin as the years progressed. Kubla Khan surely showed this change by creating a new means of entertainment, this was the cause of how it was deemed the second coming of the Forbidden City.<sup>6</sup> The idea of having a place to eat while still having the wants of entertainment to be at your grasp, was something that helped create the boom of the cuisine of Chinatown. Chinatown has continued to be a way of collecting tourism to gain their financial standing. That continued to create a bridge between the years to help continue a new growth of Chinatown. The new boom creates an opportunity for what it means to be in Chinatown. A renewal is happening whether we can stop it or not, but with the pandemic many shops closed down and the growth they gained through the century flipped on its head. With the closed shops, new shops took their place that brought in new clientele to step foot in the neighborhood. With the neighborhood being highly affected by the multiple stops that derailed their advances, people say it as a chance to build new ideas that replaced many of the ones that Chinatown used to follow.</p>\n                <p>As a gathering place, Kubla Khan gave a new source of income to Chinatown and breathed new life into the neighborhood.The price of a meal in Kubla Khan in the mid 1940s to the late 1950s was around $2.50, which amounts to around $53.42 now. The nightlife of Kubla Khan was not the only thing bridging the gap from Chinatown residents to white San Franciscans, but food also played a role in this process. Chop suey is the first known Chinese American dish that helped introduce the taste of Chinese food to Americans without it being “othered”.<sup>7</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/culturefood/image2.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                        Empress of China before it got shut down\n                        <br/>\n                        <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sf.eater.com/2021/6/16/22533426/empress-by-boon-opening-menu-san-francisco&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683521914566161&usg=AOvVaw0rGUWaptm7C3gJfpK11Jx1\">Patricia Chang</a>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Food continues to change the face of Chinatown and what social life looks like for the community. After the <a href=\"#/culture/golden-dragon\">Golden Dragon Massacre</a> in 1977, the idea of gathering in eateries became almost obsolete. Restaurants lost business and the energy of Chinatown changed for what felt like the worst. The fear surrounding the massacre shoved Chinatown back into being “othered”. Almost 43 years after the massacre, Covid-19 engrossed the world and changed the meaning of socialization in Chinatown. Socializing in Chinatown became even more difficult, causing significant damage to the economy of Chinatown. Chinatown once again became ostracized to be seen as a tourist site and not a place to go for one’s own pleasure. Then came the bursts of new restaurants that have come to Chinatown within the recent years. Empress by Boon has been a new attraction that has occupied the vacant Empress of China, bringing in non-Chinatown residents to the area. The dishes include Chinese food that still maintains the original ideas but adds a new twist, such as their ‘Winter Perigord Truffle Puff’. They have nothing that strives away from the idea of Chinese food, but the upscale setting of the restaurant as well as the plating signals a new direction for food in Chinatown.</p>\n                <p>Like Kubla Khan, entertainment in Chinatown is being revived in a way that shows how far Chinese Americans have come from the past. Before, ingredients to make authentic Chinese food were practically inaccessible with how niche the marketplace kept culturally significant foods,  the Americanization of Chinese food. However, Chinese ingredients have become increasingly accessible, and are not considered “othered” as they were back then. Kubla Khan broke the ground for what it means to eat in Chinatown, and with new restaurants coming in, the idea of entertainment in Chinatown is changing right before us. Kubla Khan was not the stop of how Chinatown was starting to change in a newer direction. New restaurants and cultural institutions around had the effect of changing the outside perceptions and the internal dynamics of Chinatown.</p>\n            </div>\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup>Liu, H.

More than that, it provided a platform for aspiring Asian American performing artists to showcase their talents, and a uniquely Asian American performing arts space. As Frances Chun recounts, “It was the first place we could really call our own.”<sup>3</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText left\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/forbiddencity/image1.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Credit: Coby Yee\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Charlie Low, the proprietor of the Forbidden City, opened the nightclub at 363 Sutter Street in 1938, after the success of his cocktail bar, Chinese Village. However, the Forbidden City was not always successful from the start—namely, it did not reach its high levels of success until Low began to market the nightclub’s Chinese performers.<sup>4</sup> One of the most popular acts was the burlesque bubble and fan dance, performed by Noel Toy, known as the “Chinese Sally Rand”. Other popular acts included Larry Ching, the “Chinese Frank Sinatra”; Dorothy Toy and Paul Wing, the “Chinese Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire”; Tony Wing; Coby Yee, “China’s Most Daring Dancing Doll”; and Frances Quan Chun, also known as “Chinese Frances Langford”. Each performer had a loyal following of fans, which kept the Forbidden City alive, according to Tony Wing: “That’s what kept the club going: we all had a following.”<sup>5</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText right\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/forbiddencity/image2.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                        Photo of Jadin Wong\n                        <br/>Credit: Courtesy of Arthur Dong’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deepfocusproductions.com/films/forbidden-city-usa/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683522438800039&usg=AOvVaw3wrUGkTmIpFtxj03T-RVBI\">\"Forbidden City, USA”</a><br/> Chinatown Nightclubs Collection.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Though the Forbidden City capitalized on outdated racial stereotypes of Asian Americans, it also was a site of innovation, revolution, and created a new Chinese American culture. According to Frances Chun, “What we did in the thirties and forties was shocking to the Chinese community and confusing to the Cauasian people… but to be a singer and a dancer? Well, that’s quite different, quite unique.” The performers at the time were not only able to change the way that Asian Americans were viewed, but also able to bring about new opportunities for Asian American entertainers. After the Forbidden City, headlining dancer Jadin Wong went on to start a talent agency specializing in Asian Americans, nurturing upcoming artists in ways that were not possible during her time: in her words, “All my experience and what I’ve learned, now I try to give to the Asian American actors that are coming into this business—to help them and nurture them so that they can have a future in this business with less heartaches than I had when I first started.” Tony Wing taught dance in San Francisco at the YWCA for thirty years, continuing to inspire young people interested in performing arts. These Asian American artists were trailblazers. In the words of Larry Ching, “One thing I’m glad about is that we were breakin’ the ice for all the people, you know. We gave ‘em a good start. So I mean, now it’s a lot better for them. We showed ‘em that we had a little talent—and we had some talent.”<sup>7</sup></p>\n                <br/>\n                <div className=\"imgText lastPic\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/forbiddencity/image3.jpg')}/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                        Tony Wing with his students at YWCA, San francisco\n                        <br/>Credit: Courtesy of Arthur Dong’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deepfocusproductions.com/films/forbidden-city-usa/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683522438800039&usg=AOvVaw3wrUGkTmIpFtxj03T-RVBI\">\"Forbidden City, USA”</a><br/> Chinatown Nightclubs Collection.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup><i>Forbidden City</i>, U.S.A., n.d.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup>ayanac2411, “Forbidden City the Double Entendre and the Emergence of Chinese American,” digital Humanities studio, May 31, 2022, <a href=\"https://docstudio.org/2021/12/16/forbidden-city-the-double-entendre-and-the-emergence-of-chinese-american/\">https://docstudio.org/2021/12/16/forbidden-city-the-double-entendre-and-the-emergence-of-chinese-american/</a>.\n                    </li> \n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup>Arthur E.

In 2016, Hsu bought back Clarion after an eleven-year hiatus, and rebranded the long-standing Clarion Music Center as the Clarion Performing Arts Center in 2019. Clarion provided musical resources for the San Francisco Chinatown community for almost 35 years, and now continues to empower the Asian American community in the Bay Area with its arts and cultural programs.[2] The Clarion Performing Arts Center also houses the Showgirl Magic Museum, paying homage to the nightlife performers of the Golden Age.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/grantave/img4.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>Grant Ave. Follies centerpiece at the Showgirl Magic Museum</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Costumes, headdresses, and other memorabilia live at the museum, including beautiful dresses, worn and handmade by Coby Yee, who was known as “China’s Most Daring Dancing Doll,” and even a pair of tap shoes worn by Tony Wing.[3][4] </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/grantave/img5.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>Community art wall at Clarion Performing Arts Center</figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The Grant Ave. Follies are redefining what it means to bring joy into their community, and their own lives, with every performance they do — that’s the Follies’ mission. And they are anything but quiet meek old ladies: in the words of Cynthia Yee, “I think everywhere that we go, whether it’s to a restaurant or anything, we do attract a lot of attention. And not only because we make a lot of noise, but because, you know, we would normally get our hair done, and we normally put on makeup. And people want to know who we are. And because we’re not the average 75, 80, 85 year old person, everybody, young people come up to us and say, “Wow, you look fantastic.” I wish my grandma could join you.” They bring this energy to their <a href=\"http://grantavenuefollies.com/gai-mou-sou-rap/\">Gai Mou Sou Rap</a>, speaking up against anti-Asian hate crimes towards the elderly, and to their <a href=\"http://grantavenuefollies.com/glammas-wrap/\">Glammas Wrap</a>, celebrating the richness of the Chinese American experience.[5][6] They also want to inspire the younger generation to chase their dreams.</p>\n                <p>Mimi Chin, one of the Follies, holds the sentiment that there’s so much in the world to see — don’t just sit there and think about it, go out and experience it.</p>\n                <p>Marlene Luke, another Follie: “Build on it. Stick on it. Come out of your skin.\"</p>\n                <p>Emily Wong: “Oh, go for it. But it’s not easy. You have to be persistent. And help each other out.”</p>\n                <p>Finally, from Avis See-tho: “Be open-minded. And you know, not one is better than the other. Everything has its meaning, so don’t just say, oh, I hate that. Be open-minded to it.”</p>\n                <p>These are the values that the Grant Avenue Follies embody: joy, hope, and pure glamour. If you’d like to see the Follies in action, they perform monthly at the Lion’s Den in San Francisco Chinatown.

The hospital serves a diverse patient population, including speakers of Cantonese, Mandarin, and other dialects. In addition to general medical care, the hospital also offers specialized services such as acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and geriatric care. These services are particularly important to the Chinese community due to its larger aging population, and limited English proficiency among community members.<sup>1</sup> It was founded in 1925 in response to the needs of the Chinese community in San Francisco.</p>\n                <p>Despite the relatively well-known history of Chinese immigration and settlement in California, the issue of their access to healthcare is often overlooked.The Chinese community was historically villainized as a public health threat. Chinatown was portrayed as a place filled with “opium fumes, tobacco smoke, and putrefying waste <sup>pervading</sup> the atmosphere.”<sup>2</sup> Not immune to racist ideas of that time, public health investigations supported the notion that Chinese people, because of their distinct culture and biology, posed a threat to white America. The bubonic plague and smallpox epidemics intensified the racialization of disease, and Chinese immigrants were blamed as the culprits of these diseases.<sup>3</sup></p>\n                <p>At the same time, Chinese immigrants faced exclusion from social and political institutions, which limited their access to public services such as education and healthcare. Chinese immigrants were required to pay a hospital tax, but were denied access to San Francisco City and County Hospitals, even with severe medical conditions.<sup>4</sup> Distance, violence, and linguistic barriers further hindered Chinese immigrants’ access to healthcare. Thus, Chinese physicians were often the preferred sources of care for Chinese immigrants, as they provided familiar methods of diagnosis and treatment in a more trusted setting. Due to the historic exclusion of Chinese people from Western healthcare institutions, Chinese physicians and TCM are still the preferred sources of care for many families, and San Francisco’s Chinese Hospital remains an important healthcare provider today.</p>\n                <br />\n\n                <h2>Chinese Hospital</h2>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/chinesehosp/image1.jpg')} />\n                <sup>5</sup>\n                <br />\n                <p>The Chinese Hospital stands as a testament to the determination and resilience of the Chinese community in San Francisco, having been established in 1925 to provide much-needed medical care to a population that was historically excluded from Western medical institutions. The hospital was the brainchild of the Chinese Six Companies, a prominent Chinese-American community organization that was founded in 1882. The notion of establishing a hospital specifically for the Chinese community was first introduced in the 1890s, when the Chinese community submitted a petition to the Board of Health requesting permission to do so. Unfortunately, their proposal was met with rejection, as the Board deemed the idea to be both a nuisance and a hazard to the surrounding neighborhood.<sup>6</sup></p>\n                <p>Nevertheless, the Chinese community continued to push for a medical facility that would provide comprehensive care to its people. In 1900, the Board of Supervisors finally granted permission for a Chinese dispensary to be opened in Chinatown, which served as a basic medical center for the Chinese community. The drive to establish a comprehensive medical facility persisted over the following two decades, and in 1924, the Chinese Six Companies acquired a building on Jackson Street, which was transformed into a hospital. The hospital officially opened its doors in 1925, consisting of 50 beds and a team of Chinese physicians, nurses, and support staff.</p>\n                <p>The Chinese Hospital quickly established itself as an indispensable institution in the Chinese community, offering a range of medical specialties, including surgery, obstetrics, and pediatrics.  Despite the struggles of securing consistent funding during the early years of its establishment, influential figures in the Chinese physician community continued to support the Chinese Hospital.</p>\n                <p>The vision of providing a cost effective health care option that serves the needs of the SF Chinatown community has remained the same throughout the years.Today, the hospital has expanded its services and continues to provide high-quality care to the Chinatown community. After receiving the Hill Burton grant in the 1970s, the hospital went beyond offering healthcare facilities and began advocating for education resources through the founding of the Chinese Community Health Care Association (CCHCA). Today, the Chinese Hospital collaborates with its organization partners to better healthcare services, as well as to advocate for greater access of healthcare for underprivileged residents. In doing so, it has expanded community health on a broader scale and built stronger bonds of trust with its patients.<sup>7</sup></p>\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/chinesehosp/image2.png')} />\n                <br /><br />\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/chinesehosp/image3.jpg')} />\n                <br /><br />\n                <img src={require('../../assets/images/chinesehosp/image4.jpg')} />\n                <br /><br />\n                <p>Its rich and illustrious history spans over a century, and the hospital serves as an emblem of the city's cultural and medical heritage. It is a testament to the resilience and strength of the Chinese community and a symbol of hope and healing for all who walk through its doors. The Chinese Hospital continues to be a vital resource for the San Francisco community, and its legacy of excellence in healthcare will endure for generations to come.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup> Chow, Edward A, Bernard Lau, L.

American concepts of mental health focused on individualistic notions of self-improvement, which conflicted with more collectivist values in Chinese culture.</p>\n                <p>Mental health continues to be a misunderstood and stigmatized topic within the Chinese American community. In more traditional Chinese communities, mental illness may be viewed as a weakness or a personal flaw rather than a medical condition. Rather than seeking external assistance or treatment, Chinese culture emphasizes strategies like avoiding morbid and negative thoughts as a solution to mental health issues.<sup>3</sup> This stigma can prevent individuals from seeking help, and can contribute to a sense of shame and isolation. Additionally, collectivist values and more traditional family roles can make it difficult for individuals to acknowledge and address their own mental health needs, as they may feel pressure to prioritize the needs of their family or community above their own. Psychological distress among Chinese American children is often magnified as their roles and values at home may contradict their roles and values in school. The model minority myth creates particularly damaging expectations, as people struggle to live up to the portrayals of Asians as obedient, smart, and financially successful. This stereotype places additional pressure on Chinese and Asian American communities, while also undermining the experiences of those who fall outside of the model of white capitalist success.<sup>4</sup></p>\n                <p>Historically, San Francisco Chinatown has consisted of low-income migrants who face additional stressors. According to a 2015 article in the San Francisco Chronicle, the median household income is $91,938 in San Francisco, compared to Chinatown’s median household income of $25,909.<sup>5</sup> With around 50% of residents having limited English proficiency, language barriers continue to pose a challenge for socioeconomic integration, playing a large role in Chinatown residents’ struggle with high poverty and unemployment rates.<sup>6</sup> Several additional factors mean that resources are spread thinly in Chinatown households, including the presence of larger households and larger populations of elderly and youth, further contributing to psychological distress within the Chinatown community.<sup>7</sup></p>\n                <p>In conversation with prominent public health expert, community organizer and retired physician Marilyn Wong, a prominent public health expert community organizer and retired physician, noted that mental health was one of the main health issues affecting the community along with higher rates of liver cancers, oropharyngeal cancers, and type 2 diabetes. Among more recent immigrants, Wong noticed that many white collar professionals migrating to the United States reported feelings of worthlessness regarding their own skills. Facing language barriers and downward economic mobility, these immigrants struggled with self esteem, self-confidence, and the pressure to be breadwinners for their families. On the other hand, Wong noticed that the younger generation often felt like they were carrying the burden of success, with the hopes and sacrifices of their parents and caregivers piled onto their own aspirations.</p>\n                <p>Despite these challenges, San Francisco’s Chinese American community has developed measures to address mental health in the Chinatown community. The Chinatown Public Health Center provides a range of mental health services, including therapy, medication management, and case management. Community-based organizations like Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Women's Resource Center offer mental health resources and support. The Chinatown Child Development Center (CCDC) recently celebrated its 50 year anniversary in 2022, and since then, has been advocating to reduce stigma and misunderstanding surrounding mental health among parents and caregivers. In an interview with local media, CCDC Director Linda Wu said the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the severity of mental health issues in children and youth, requiring more comprehensive long-term treatment. The pandemic has intensified young people’s fears for their own and family’s safety, along with discrimination and bullying in schools.<sup>8</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/mentalhealth/image1.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <p>While there are community-based organizations and mental health providers offering services, there is still a significant need for increased funding and resources to expand the reach and availability of mental health services in the community. Joyce Cheng, Executive Director of the Chinese Community Health Resource Center, emphasized the role that the Chinese Hospital will play in this effort. Its goals include improving access and provision of mental health support and services over the next few years, along with more linguistically appropriate services.  Language barriers remain a significant challenge, as many individuals in the Chinatown community primarily speak Cantonese or Mandarin. While there are some mental health providers who offer services in these languages, there may be limited availability, and individuals may face challenges navigating the healthcare system.</p>\n                <p>Wong remembers working as a community organizer in San Francisco in the 1970s, when she would often find herself taking the bus with community members who needed her help to translate during medical visits at San Francisco General Hospital. “If you cannot communicate, that’s a big detriment to your health,” she said, noting the difficulty for healthcare providers to figure out an appropriate diagnosis or treatment plan due to language barriers. It also made it more difficult to build rapport between patients and providers, impacting quality of care. On these bus rides, Wong said she would often hear about community members’ deep worries about their own health, and how hurried visits to the doctor’s office did not allow them to share these concerns. For example, a stomachache could trigger concerns regarding gastric cancer, but there would be no opportunity to bring this up with the doctor during the short five-minute visit.</p>\n                <p>Therefore, culturally relevant, linguistically appropriate, and adaptive care is a crucial pathway to increasing mental health services and supporting the diverse needs of the San Francisco Chinatown community. Despite efforts to increase mental health awareness, stigma is still a significant barrier to accessing care for many individuals. Additionally, there may be a lack of trust in Western-style mental health treatments among community members, who may prefer alternative therapies including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and mind-body practices such as meditation, qigong, and taichi. Efforts to reduce stigma, increase accessibility, and provide culturally competent care can help to improve mental health outcomes in the Chinatown community and support overall wellbeing.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>1</sup> Bertolote J.

It is a form of traditional medicine that uses natural herbs, roots, and plants to treat a wide range of ailments and illnesses. In San Francisco Chinatown, as well as other Asian American communities throughout the United States, Chinese herbal medicine has remained an important aspect of healthcare, despite the growing popularity of modern medicine.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                        San Francisco Chinatown is a vibrant community that is rich in culture and tradition. This strong connection to the past makes Chinese herbal medicine not only a form of healthcare, but a way of life. Because of its deep roots in Chinese cultural and spiritual beliefs, many Chinese Americans believe that TCM can help to restore balance and harmony within the body.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                        Barriers to accessing western medicine play a role in the popularity of herbal medicine among Chinese immigrants in the United States. Many Chinese immigrants in the United States are uninsured or underinsured, making it difficult to access Western medical care.[2] In addition, language barriers and cultural differences can make it challenging for Chinese immigrants to navigate the western healthcare system, further limiting their access to treatment. For these reasons, many Chinese immigrants turn to traditional Chinese medicine as a more accessible and familiar form of healthcare. In addition to its therapeutic benefits, Chinese herbal medicine plays an important role in the cultural and social fabric of the Asian American community. It is often used as a way to bring people together, whether it be through the sharing of remedies and recipes or through its use in traditional ceremonies and rituals.[3]\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/traditionalmedicine/image1.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            <sup>1</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                <p>Community health worker Marilyn Wong noted that many Chinese patients were incredibly knowledgeable about staying healthy and preventing illnesses based on Chinese traditional medical principles, such as the concept of “balance,” which determines which foods can be eaten to treat different conditions. However, this knowledge is often different from a western framework, which is based on a seemingly scientific but actually rather dogmatic approach of believing only what is published and ignoring what is yet unknown, says Wong.</p>\n                <p>As healthcare providers and Chinatown organizations continue to improve health equity and accessibility for the community members, there is an observable change in ways people seek health treatment. Many hospitals that serve Chinese residents have integrated TCM into a specialized department, offering acupuncture and traditional medicine prescriptions. This institutional recognition of TCM’s benefits offers a bridge between Chinese and western integrative treatments.</p>\n                <p>Wong noted that many Chinese people found Western medicine “too strong” in reference to the side effects of prescribed treatments, while they didn’t feel these issues with TCM. Given these tensions, Wong emphasized the importance of physicians and healthcare workers keeping the conversation open, even if they didn’t agree with patients’ opinions. “You have to make the relationship open enough so they are willing to tell you about the Chinese medicine they are taking or what treatments they are going through.”</p>\n                <p>By offering multilingual communication support and personalized health check-ins, healthcare institutions begin to build relationships of trust and reliance with Chinatown residents. A 76-year-old resident told us about her usual healthcare routine during an interview, saying “Usually I go to the hospital, make appointments, it’s pretty convenient. The nurses there speak Cantonese.” Through conversations with acupuncture clinics in Chinatown, we observed that the audience for TCM ranges broadly, from young adults to senior residents. As community members have fought for more equitable healthcare over the past decades, TCM has also become a more commonly accepted alternative treatment for members of the Chinatown community.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>1</sup> “San Francisco Chinatown Traditional Medicine,” Kelly Ma, 2023, digital photograph, personal collection, April 12 , 2023.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>2</sup>Ng, D.

Driven by Protestant missionary goals, white women sought to “civilize” other cultures by teaching domestic skills both in the United States and abroad.<sup>3</sup> In San Francisco, this effort focused on Chinese immigrant women, who faced criticism from city leaders for threatening the “white race” by lowering wages, defying authority, and spreading diseases in the 1870s and 1880s.<sup>4</sup> Through initiatives like the Chinese Mission Home, white women aimed to turn Chinese women into domestic servants, teachers, and middle-class housewives. These missionaries hoped that promoting Christian values and \"civilized\" domesticity would transform Chinatown and establish a more acceptable family structure among the Chinese community.</p>\n                <p>As healthcare providers and Chinatown organizations continue to improve health equity and accessibility for the community members, there is an observable change in ways people seek health treatment.

Missionary concerns over Chinatown’s cleanliness failed to address the discriminatory laws and social norms that restricted Chinese immigrants to living in cramped quarters. The inadequate facilities for sanitation and hygiene in these neighborhoods were exacerbated by neglect and underinvestment in public services. The lack of political representation for Chinese Americans also meant that they had little ability to shape decisions related to urban planning and infrastructure. Addressing these systemic issues was necessary to improve the living conditions of the Chinese American community.</p>\n                <p>In the 1920s and 1930s, Chinese American social workers used ideas of hygiene and domesticity to argue for better access to social services and housing. They highlighted educated Chinese American housewives as examples of American middle-class culture, challenging stereotypes and claiming their right to civic participation and resources. A prominent figure during this period was Dr. Margaret Chung, the first American-born Chinese woman to become a physician. Known as “Mom Chung,” she became famous during World War II for her patriotism, sending care packages to troops and hosting weekly Sunday suppers for regular soldiers and prominent figures. Despite her wartime celebrity status, she was never given public credit due to her age, race, disruption of gender norms, and suspected relationships with other women.<sup>5</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/womenshealth/image2.png')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>“Women of every nation, every country, should learn medicine, so that they can teach the women of their countries and their races how to care for themselves and their children—how to improve the coming generation.” Margaret Chung, Los Angeles Herald profile, 1914<sup>6</sup></p>\n                <p>Today, Chinese immigrant women in the United States continue to face unique health challenges and disparities, including limited access to culturally sensitive reproductive healthcare, prenatal care, and breast and cervical cancer screenings. Mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD also arise from the stress of immigration, acculturation, and discrimination, but often go untreated due to cultural stigma and lack of appropriate services. Additionally, these women may be at a higher risk for chronic illnesses, experience barriers to healthcare access, and face domestic violence or abuse, with limited resources for support. Many work in low-wage, labor-intensive jobs, increasing their risk of work-related injuries or illnesses. Addressing these health issues necessitates culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate health care services, as well as targeted health education and outreach programs for Chinese immigrant women.</p>\n                <p>\n                Fortunately, efforts have been made to improve health care access and services for Chinese immigrant women. Community-based organizations such as the Chinatown Public Health Center offer a full array of services, including community health education and specific programs like the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program.<sup>7</sup> Collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, and community organizations is necessary to develop targeted solutions that address the contemporary healthcare concerns of Chinese immigrant women. By advocating for more equitable access to healthcare services, resources, and education, we can work towards a more inclusive healthcare system that caters to the diverse needs of all communities in the United States.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>1</sup>Shah.

Parks and plazas serve as important sites for people of all ages to socialize, exercise, and play. This is doubly true for underserved neighborhoods like Chinatown, which has served as a landing pad for multi-generational immigrant families throughout its history. Due to the high cost of living and a lack of economic opportunities, many of these families are forced to live in small, overcrowded spaces. Residents lack space to gather with friends and family. Despite knowing this intense need for open space, it is extremely challenging to address the issue due to the neighborhood’s lack of undeveloped land. As such, Chinatown has the smallest amount of park space per resident of any San Francisco neighborhood. \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                Over the decades, disinvestment, bulky new construction, and bureaucracy have threatened Chinatown’s limited public spaces. Grassroots advocacy organizations like the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown have fought to preserve the quantity and quality of Chinatown’s public open spaces. Through legal battles, public-nonprofit partnerships, and community-centered design, they have successfully protected and improved the quality of Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground and Portsmouth Square. Through political maneuvering and creative designs, they have also expanded Chinatown’s open space portfolio to include the Alleyways Program and the Woh Hei Yuen Park.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default PublicSpaces","import React from 'react';\nimport './AudioPlayer.css';\n\nconst AudioPlayer = (url) => {\n    return (\n        <audio id=\"audio_tag\" src={url.url} controls/>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default AudioPlayer;","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport AudioPlayer from '../../components/AudioPlayer';\nimport \"./Alleyways.css\";\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst Alleyways = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"alleyways-page\">\n            <div className=\"alleyways-intro\">\n                <h2>Alleyways Program</h2>\n                <p>At first glance, Chinatown’s alleyways seem to be secluded and private spaces. While popular media represent alleyways as neglected, deserted, even dangerous, with many housing dumpsters and serving as sites for unwanted activities,<sup>1</sup> Chinatown alleyways present a different reality. In Chinatown, alleyways could well serve as gathering places, mini gardens, and public art spaces that enrich Chinatown’s community and infrastructure. Upon closer inspection, city leaders and community activists have found that the alleyways hold great potential to combat the shortage of open recreational space in San Francisco’s Chinatown.</p>\n                <h3>A Space for Socialization</h3>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/alleyways/image2.jpg')} className=\"vertical-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Ross Alley<sup>2</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>The alleyways in Chinatown are numerous, but three key sites emblematic of their characteristics are the Spofford, St. Louis, and Salmon alleys. For clarity, the following observations are drawn from historical documents, pre-renovation. Spofford is a mixed-used alleyway situated between Stockton Street and Grant Avenue, and connecting Clay and Washington Street on the opposite ends. Seven mixed-use buildings<sup>3</sup> line its front border, all of which also house residential units, naturally eliciting a plethora of ‘neighborly’ social activity throughout the day. Sewing shops and factories generate an incessant buzz of commercial noise and activity. Everyday conversations and busy SF traffic add to the ambient noise. Meanwhile, workers will trickle in and out of buildings during various times, gathering outside during rest breaks and mealtimes. The loudest gatherings are on the weekends at noon, when friends and family will arrive to pick up workers and chat by the door, right along the street perimeter. Especially when schools are not in session, on the weekends, after-hours, and breaks, children are brought to play in the alleyways as their mothers work away in the bordering sweatshops. Old men are another major demographic in these spaces, and can be seen walking to and from the social clubs. As a result, visitors have described the alley as “neighborly” and lax. Also, because vehicular traffic is mostly limited to commercial trucks dropping off goods for local merchants, pedestrians will often crowd the center of the alley during non-business hours. The population using the alleyway is thus cross-sectional and intergenerational. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) the social function of the Spofford alley, cleanliness has been a pressing issue.  Trash and debris pile onto the streets and are often blown in different directions by the wind, creating an environment that actually works against the intended use of the alley space.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/alleyways/image1.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Spofford St, Washington St entrance<sup>4</sup> \n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>St. Louis is also home to many mixed-use buildings, but it is nonetheless evident that a sense of community and neighborhood still exists there —the alley is best described not as “cramped,” but “cozy.” St. Louis differs from Spofford, however, in that it is a 10-foot wide dead-end alley permitting only pedestrians to come in and out.<sup>5</sup> Being closed off to traffic, it has conveniently enabled the development of ‘seating areas’ in the rear. During afternoon hours, for example, the alley is transformed into a social hub, providing space for factory workers to take breaks and socialize.</p>\n                <p>The alley borders several reading rooms gambling and mah-jong clubs, and sewing factories. There, women are greeted by their spouses and children when they take breaks from work and mah-jong games. People gather and have conversations with one another. The elderly and the youth mingle as they flow from one place to the next. Children use the alley as their playground as they invent  simple games such as “line-racing” down these long, narrow spaces. Like Spofford, the St. Louis alley is prone to neglect and trash build-up. Keeping these alleys in optimal condition remains a challenge.</p>\n                <h3>A Public and Private Area</h3>\n                <p>Who “owns” these alleys remains ambiguous. By federal law, they are an open, public pedestrian way. Yet, the locals have a strong sense of ownership over them.<sup>6</sup> After all, without the attention and care of the residents and businesses, the alleyways would become abandoned, discarded, and lifeless. While used mostly by locals, non-locals often visit the alleyways out of curiosity, and the residents embrace their interest with open arms, allowing them to fully appreciate the bustling Chinese culture, smells, and vitality nested inside.</p>\n                <p>And even though the alleyways are officially public roads, they seem to occupy the nexus of public and private. The alleyways are spaces shared by occupants whose buildings outline the perimeter of the alleys.  Doors often open immediately to stairwells, and such close proximity between the private home and the public street define the alleyway not as a separate entity, but an integral part of a community’s residential life.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <AudioPlayer \n                        url=\"../assets/audio/alleyways/part1.m4a\"\n                    />\n                    <figcaption>Introduction to Mui Ho + Jennie Lew</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <figure>\n                    <AudioPlayer \n                        url=\"../assets/audio/alleyways/part2.m4a\"\n                    />\n                    <figcaption>How ‘private’ is the alley space? When visitors enter the alleyways, how are they treated by local residents?</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <p>The ambiguous perception of the alleys as neither fully public nor fully private has contributed to their less-than-ideal conditions.  While locals actively repurpose the alleyways to serve the needs of their community, residents’ efforts to clean the streets with brooms and home appliances are insufficient in clearing all the tourist and commercial waste that accumulate in the alleys.<sup>7</sup> Meanwhile, the City does not see itself as being responsible for their upkeep. Despite the ongoing challenges of maintenance, the alleys continue to play an important role in the spatially-impacted Chinatown. The hope is that with continued beautification efforts and physical renovations, these alleyways will remain vital hubs for community gatherings and the social activities taking place there now will be further encouraged, even amplified.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <AudioPlayer \n                        url=\"../assets/audio/alleyways/part3.m4a#t=0,300\"\n                    />\n                    <figcaption>Mui and Jennie on layered mix-use purposes and how different user groups interacted with the alleyways, from children playing on the streets, to commercial vehicle unloading</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <h3>Potential for Recreational Growth</h3>\n                <p>Open recreational space in Chinatown was deemed a “high-need” issue by the SF Department of Recreation and Parks in 1970,<sup>8</sup> and it remains a critical issue now. Overcrowded residential areas, large numbers of low-income families, and cross-generational populations living in close proximity are key factors that contribute to Chinatown’s growing density, which is 10 times that of the rest of San Francisco. This creates an incredible demand for open space.</p>\n                <p>In most crowded cities, residents can often drive to a nearby park for recreational activities. However, for Chinatown residents, a number of impediments discourage their utilization of recreational resources outside their immediate neighborhood. For instance, many residents have to work long hours just to maintain an income that can support the rising cost of living in San Francisco. Language is also an issue, as most are non-English speakers. Few own private vehicles, while the sparse network of public transportation further limits their mobility. As a result, Chinatown residents rarely venture outside the neighborhood. With this understanding, the only viable solution to giving residents access to recreational areas is to create more open-spaces in Chinatown.</p>\n                <p>Given the limited space in and surrounding Chinatown, it is simply not possible to consider purchasing land. Chinatown is unfortunately sandwiched between two of the most high-demand real estate areas in San Francisco. To the east lies San Francisco’s commercial and financial district, and to the west lies Nob Hill, which is known for its luxury high-rise apartments and hotels. High real estate costs and competing land uses make acquisition of any property in the area financially unviable.<sup>9</sup></p>\n                <p>In-depth research points to alleyways as a possible alternative. Open space is almost non-existent in Chinatown and the little space that does exist is generally reserved for housing and commercial purposes. Alleyways, conveniently, are already widely dispersed, accessible to residents, and do not need to be purchased by the city because they are already owned by the city.<sup>10</sup> Moreover, because alleys are generally not traffic-heavy, their closure would not contribute to increased congestion and hazards in other crowded streets.<sup>11</sup> </p>\n                <figure>\n                    <AudioPlayer \n                        url=\"../assets/audio/alleyways/part4.m4a\"\n                    />\n                    <figcaption>Mui and Jennie, on the conceptual planning phase, and why alleyways were studied so extensively</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <figure>\n                    <AudioPlayer \n                        url=\"../assets/audio/alleyways/part5.m4a\"\n                    />\n                    <figcaption>Jennie, on securing initial funding sources for the open space alleyway improvements, and Jennie and Mui on possible areas where funding was distributed to</figcaption>\n                </figure>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>1</sup>philip. 2020. “The Backstreets of San Francisco.” Modiv.

Thus, maintenance and constant improvement of this key park were always vitally important to Chinatown residents, young and old alike<sup>5</sup>.</p>\n                <p>The Square underwent many phases of renovations throughout the 20th century: a major city public parking garage was constructed under the park for the convenience of tourists and Chinese from outside Chinatown to visit the community, new restrooms and elevators were built; new and refurbished playgrounds, benches, and game tables provided for both active and passive uses and recreational activities; a community room infilled the area under the bridge that spanned Kearny Street (connecting the hotel to the park), and a large, flat plaza allowed for large group activities and assembly. These developments all help define the many functions of Portsmouth Square as we know it today — as both a historic park and a modern, lively gathering center for the Chinese community.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_3.jpeg')} className='vertical-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Portsmouth Square’s Goddess of Democracy Statue<sup>6</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Founding and Early History</h3>\n                <p>Portsmouth Square is situated on the north side of the city’s Financial District, bordered by Kearny Street to the east, Washington Street to the north, Clay Street to the south, and Walter U Lum Place to the west.</p>\n                <p>Portsmouth Square can be found where the initial public square, The Grand Plaza, was established in the early 1800s within the Mexican community of Yerba Buena. As early as 1833, the area was utilized as a location for public meetings, and in 1835 it was officially designated as a plaza.<sup>7</sup> In the course of the Mexican-American War, Captain John Berrien Montgomery was instructed to capture Yerba Buena while serving aboard the USS Portsmouth.<sup>8</sup> On July 9, 1846, Montgomery and a group of 17 soldiers arrived, planted the initial American flag, and claimed the territory.<sup>9</sup> It was later renamed Portsmouth Square in honor of the U.S. Navy ship.<sup>10</sup> Over time, the location of Portsmouth Square has shifted slightly in relation to the waterfront of San Francisco due to land reclamation projects and other changes in the city's geography.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_4.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Sailing ship \"U.S.S.

At the time, the square was a popular gathering place for locals and visitors alike, and it was the site of many important events in the city's early history. However, as the city grew and developed, the waterfront began to shift further out into the bay. By the early 20th century, the location of Portsmouth Square had shifted slightly inland, and it was no longer directly adjacent to the waterfront.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_6.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Portsmouth Square in 1867<sup>14</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <p>Today, Portsmouth Square is located about six blocks inland from the San Francisco waterfront, in the heart of the city's Chinatown neighborhood. The square is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike, with its beautiful gardens, public art installations, and rich history.</p>\n                <p>In addition to its historical and cultural significance, Portsmouth Square is also connected to the nearby Hilton Hotel (previously Holiday Inn Hotel) by a pedestrian footbridge.<sup>15</sup> This bridge allows visitors to easily access both the square and the hotel by avoiding the heavy traffic on Kearny Street,<sup>16</sup> and it has become a popular spot for taking photos and enjoying panoramic views of the city.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_7.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Pedestrian Bridge Connecting Portsmouth Square to Hilton Hotel<sup>17</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <p>The Hilton Hotel is also home to the Chinese Culture Center of San Francisco, which is located on the third floor of the building. The center is dedicated to promoting and preserving Chinese culture in the Bay Area, and it offers a variety of programs and events throughout the year, including art exhibitions, performances, and workshops.<sup>18</sup> Visitors to the city can experience the unique blend of history and culture that makes this neighborhood one of the most vibrant and exciting places to visit in the Bay Area.</p>\n                <h3>Chinatown’s Living Room</h3>\n                <p>Many residents in San Francisco’s Chinatown and Tenderloin neighborhoods live in single room occupancies (SROs), where they rent small, furnished bedrooms with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms.<sup>19</sup> For many, their only private spaces are their bedrooms. As such, having access to public spaces is especially important. For those living in Chinatown, Portsmouth Square often serves as their “living room” —a space to meet up with friends, eat food, and exercise.<sup>20</sup> SROs are an important part of Chinatown’s housing stock because they serve as affordable housing for new, monolingual immigrants from Asia.<sup>21</sup> With language and social barriers, it is especially difficult for immigrants to find and maintain strong social networks. Having a public space to call their own can help facilitate this important community-building.</p>\n                <p>At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-Asian hate crimes skyrocketed, bolstered by racist stereotypes and anti-Chinese rhetoric from political leaders. After the Atlanta Spa Shootings, Asian-American leaders across the United States rallied their communities to demand an end to race-based, gender-based violence. One of the biggest protests occurred in Portsmouth Square, where speakers reaffirmed their right to live in the United States and called for greater protections for seniors.<sup>22</sup> However, this is not the first time Portsmouth Square has served as a place of protest. On August 17th, 1968, the Concerned Chinese for Action and Change, a coalition of college students from across the Bay Area, marched down Grant Street to protest poor living conditions in Chinatown. The march ended at Portsmouth Square, where speakers condemned the activities of slumlords, sweatshop owners, and local political leaders.<sup>23</sup> </p>\n                <p>Presently, Portsmouth Square is used as a community gathering space by a variety of people. For many residents in the area, social life in Chinatown is defined by the neighborhood’s many community-based organizations. These organizations use Portsmouth Square as a space to host tai chi classes, host musical performances, and circulate information about housing and other social services. The plaza is also frequented by Chinese elders, who are often gossiping and gambling with friends.<sup>24</sup> In addition, the space is used by unhoused individuals. These people often have no other place to go and call Portsmouth Square home. For the Chinatown community, Portsmouth Square is an important space for community-building, political action, and socializing.</p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_8.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Chinese elders doing exercise in Portsmouth Square<sup>25</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Struggles to Maintain Portsmouth Square</h3>\n                <p>San Francisco Chinatown, being one of the most densely populated places in the whole country, has the least amount of public open space per person of any community in San Francisco.<sup>26</sup> Therefore, open space is crucial to SF Chinatown, and the CNIRC (Chinatown Neighborhood Improvement Resource Center), now known as CCDC (Chinatown Community Development Center), considers sunlight to be an essential element for SF Chinatown’s open space.<sup>27</sup> </p>\n                <p>Everyday, senior citizens use Portsmouth Square as a social hub. Adults frequently bring their children to Portsmouth Square for fresh air and outdoor activities. Due to their limited mobility, many Chinatown residents visit Portsmouth Square as their only open space. Thus, the Portsmouth Square Master Plan was developed in order to enhance seniors' and children's recreational opportunities while also providing a secure park environment.<sup>28</sup></p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_9.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Portsmouth Square’s Playground and Gathering Area in 2016<sup>28</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <p>Funds were requested by the CBPRC (Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown) during the Community Development public hearings in 1977 to expand the Portsmouth Square children’s play area. The Office of Community Development granted $50,000 for the improvements.<sup>30</sup> After receiving the necessary funds, the CBPRC began to seek community input from residents, especially children, to help determine what improvements and recreational needs to prioritize.<sup>31</sup> </p>\n                <p>In 1978, Jennie Lew, CNIRC’s technical advisor, created a questionnaire to gather data on the needs and interests of children in Chinatown to provide a basis for the preliminary design development of Portsmouth Square’s tot lot. The survey collected data on the primary users of the play area and the preferred placement of seating, seating in relation to sunlight, surfaces for the play zones, types of activities in the play zones, etc. <sup>32</sup> Small sketches were shown to people to portray the different types of designs.<sup>5</sup></p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_10.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        Footbridge linking Portsmouth Square and Hilton Hotel/Chinese Culture Center<sup>33</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <p>Many people have asked for the pedestrian bridge connecting the Holiday Inn to Portsmouth Square to be removed because it shades the tot lot in Portsmouth. A larger elevator building to the Portsmouth Square Garage parking was also requested, but this may have an adverse effect on the upper terrace.<sup>34</sup></p>\n                <p>In 1983, the Office of Community Development granted the CBPRC $90,000 to re-equip and move Portsmouth Square’s tot lot to a sunny location since its original location is shaded by the pedestrian bridge. However, the new location is exactly where the Bank of Canton shadow will fall. According to the Planning Department Environmental Review Officer Alec Bash, this technical error resulted from the  Environmental Science Associates’ miscalculation on the EIR (Environmental Impact Report) of the Bank of Canton. Bash mentions that the accurate measurements indicate there will be 15 more hours of shade than was previously reported. The error was discovered by the UC Environmental Stimulation Laboratory in a study. As a result of the embarrassment due to certifying an error document as accurate, the Planning Commission refused to penalize the Bank of Canton.<sup>35</sup></p>\n                <p>In the end, a phasing plan for implementation was created in the Portsmouth Square Master Plan. In Phase I, a new elevator building and restrooms connected to the open air portal at the bridge's entrance, a game table area near the intersection of Kearny Street and Washington Street, and a multi-level play area placed to maximize sunlight and minimize wind would be constructed. In addition, a maintenance storage area would be renovated. The upper plaza level will be renovated in Phase II, with new paving, seating, and raised lawn areas. The lower plaza will be renovated in Phase III, with new paving, seating, and planting. In Phase IV, a senior citizens' recreation building beneath the bridge will be constructed to offer a recreational space during poor weather.<sup>36</sup></p>\n                <p className=\"quote-title\">Prop K - Portsmouth Square</p>\n                <p className=\"quote\">On the June 1984 ballot, San Francisco citizens passed Prop K, the Sunlight Ordinance,  in response to growing concern about the effects of buildings' shadows on the city's open spaces. The ordinance covered all properties under the Recreation and Park Commission's jurisdiction or designated for acquisition. Section 295 of the city planning code requires the planning commission to make a finding that any shadow cast by the project on property under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park department is insignificant before issuing a permit for a project that exceeds 40 feet in height.<sup>37</sup></p>\n\n                <h3>The Future of Portsmouth Square</h3>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_11.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        New Portsmouth Square aerial overview<sup>38</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n                <p>MEI Architects and SWA Group have been hired by the Recreation & Parks Department of San Francisco to work on the improvements project for Portsmouth Square.<sup>39</sup> The project aims to create a vision for the park that will benefit future generations by improving the park's plantings, paving, playground areas, lighting, and furnishings. The project will also include a new community clubhouse with a large assembly area, restrooms, and smaller meeting rooms. The joint venture team has led a year-long community engagement planning and concept design phase, which included public workshops and working with community groups, key stakeholders, and coordination with city agencies.</p>\n                <p>On 22nd July 2022, District 19 Assemblymember Phil Ting announced a $4 million investment in the project to reconstruct and improve Portsmouth Square, San Francisco's Chinatown.<sup>40</sup> The redesign of the park is a \"core project\" that is expected to be completed in 2025. The Kearny Street pedestrian bridge, connecting Portsmouth Square and the Hilton Hotel, will be the first to be removed, and the redesign will include an 8,000-square-foot, two-story clubhouse, a multigenerational playground, and other changes that will open the square up for more sunshine. Portsmouth Square is the heart of San Francisco's Chinese American community, and the redesign will ensure residents get the \"vibrant and modern oasis they deserve.\"<sup>b</sup></p>\n                <figure>\n                    <img src={require('../../assets/images/portsmouth/PortsmouthSquare_12.jpeg')} className='horizontal-img'/>\n                    <figcaption>\n                        New Portsmouth Square approved schematic design<sup>41</sup>\n                    </figcaption>\n                </figure>\n                <br />\n            </div>\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>1</sup> “Portsmouth Square Community Based Transportation Plan,” SFCTA, n.d., <a href=\"https://www.sfcta.org/projects/portsmouth-square\">https://www.sfcta.org/projects/portsmouth-square</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>2</sup> “Portsmouth Square,” San Francisco Park Alliance, n.d., <a href=\"https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/portsmouth-square#:~:text=On%20July%209%2C%201846%2C%20the,the%20southwest%20corner%20of%20plaza\">https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/portsmouth-square#:~:text=On%20July%209%2C%201846%2C%20the,the%20southwest%20corner%20of%20plaza</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>3</sup> “San Francisco Chinantown Portsmouth Square and Vicinity Existing Conditions Report,” San Francisco Planning Department, December 2014, <a href=\"https://sfplanning.org/sites/default/files/documents/citywide/portsmouth-square/Portsmouth_Square_Final_Report_lores.pdf#page=111\">https://sfplanning.org/sites/default/files/documents/citywide/portsmouth-square/Portsmouth_Square_Final_Report_lores.pdf#page=111</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>4</sup> Marisol Medina-Cadena, “The Rich History of San Francisco's First Plaza,” KQED, Nov 21, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11787679/the-rich-history-of-san-franciscos-first-plaza\">https://www.kqed.org/news/11787679/the-rich-history-of-san-franciscos-first-plaza</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>5</sup>Jennie Lew (former CBPRC member), in discussion with Beverly Karnatz, Kenny Li, Caroline Lu, Terry Ow-Wing, and Fiona Yim, San Francisco, CA, March 2023.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>6</sup> Photo by Kenny Li.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>7</sup> “San Francisco Chinantown Portsmouth Square and Vicinity Existing Conditions Report,” San Francisco Planning Department, December 2014, 15, <a href=\"https://sfplanning.org/sites/default/files/documents/citywide/portsmouth-square/Portsmouth_Square_Final_Report_lores.pdf#page=111\">https://sfplanning.org/sites/default/files/documents/citywide/portsmouth-square/Portsmouth_Square_Final_Report_lores.pdf#page=111</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>8</sup> Mary Burk and Adah Bakalinsky, Stairway Walks in San Francisco: The Joy of Urban Exploring, (Wilderness Press, 2018), 12.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <sup>9</sup> Foster, Lee.

After waiting 25 years, the park was seen as an answered prayer by the community.</p>\n                <p>Proposed in 1974, Woh Hei Yuen Park is a small yet significant addition for Chinatown residents who had not seen a new park since the completion of the Chinese Playground in 1949 and the Chinese Recreation Center in 1927.<sup>2</sup> The opening of the park was celebrated on October 7, 1997, with lion dancers from the SF Police Department and the Wu Yee Children's Services. It was officially named Woh Hei Yuen, which means \"Garden of Peace and Joy.\" The name was the winner of the community's 'Name the Park' competition held earlier that year.<sup>3</sup></p>\n                <p>Back in 1969, a successful suit against the City of San Francisco found that Chinatown had the least amount of public recreational facilities and resources in the entire city, even though it had the greatest need for open space. In the same year, a group of Asian American students from UC Berkeley concluded a massive study on the allocation of resources for recreational purposes in San Francisco.<sup>4</sup> It became clear that Chinatown was the most densely populated neighborhood with the least amount of public recreational facilities and resources for recreational purposes.<sup>5</sup> Since then, numerous studies have recognized the need for more open space in Chinatown, and many have examined various options for development and improvement. They included the 1971 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 701 Study, the 1978 Neighborhood Improvement Plan, and the \"Open Space Alleyways\" report.</p>\n                <p>After a city study concluded in 1974 that Chinatown was in urgent need of more open space, members of the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown (CBPRC) started looking for a location suitable for a small park. It took many years since there was no undeveloped land in Chinatown, and it was difficult to find lots big enough for a park.</p>\n                <p>In 1990, the CBPRC, local authorities, and city representatives chose the site where Cathay Mortuary had been located.<sup>6</sup> The Cathay site located at Powell and Jackson was ideal, given its central location and size of 13,500 square feet. It also consisted of seven contiguous lots under related ownership.<sup>7</sup> The evaluation criteria for the site included core area accessibility to cater to all age groups, especially seniors and small children, as well as its size and usability for creating both active play areas and landscaped spaces for passive enjoyment. Other criteria specified that no housing could be demolished, job displacement must be minimized, and any adverse environmental impacts such as traffic, shadows, and wind must be mitigated.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/wohheiyuen/image2.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Cathay Mortuary in 1964<sup>8</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>Proposition I, passed in 1974, provided funding for open space in six “high need” neighborhoods.<sup>9</sup> However, it was only after a protracted legal struggle with the owner of the mortuary that the Board of Supervisors in 1987 voted to purchase a third-of-an-acre property through eminent domain. Efforts are foremost made to properly appraise the property targeted for acquisition by the City. If an agreed price and terms fail, the legal process then permits the “greater public good” to prevail with a forced sale at a “fair market price” by a government agency to the private owner.</p>\n                <p>The City eminent domain of the Cathay Mortuary properties was an arduous and lengthy process, legally led by the City Attorney’s office (i.e., specifically Attny. Andrew Swart) and involving innumerable public hearings attended by a wide coalition of community non-profit organizations and countless individuals that supported the CBPRC for years. According to Terry Ow-Wing, a former  member of the CBPRC, the need for extra park space won over most people, even though some local residents might not look forward to playing in a park on the site of a former morgue. \"If you believe in the community, you want to look forward and not look back,\" she said.<sup>10</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/wohheiyuen/image3.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The CBPRC Members <br/>(Left to Right - Jennie Lew w/son Jordan Fong, Gary Wong, Doreen Der, Terry Ow-Wing), <br/>holding a conceptual rendering of a proposed new Chinatown park in front of the Cathay Mortuary site on Powell Street, <br/>during eminent domain hearings by the City of San Francisco.<sup>11</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>The design and construction of the project were managed by the Department of Public Works and the Recreation and Park Department.<sup>12</sup> The planning process, which began in 1991, was led by the CBPRC and Rec and Park Department Planner Deborah Learner, with input from seniors, childcare providers, school children, and residents in eleven workshops. The initial plan incorporated their needs and suggestions, which were integrated by DPW (Dept. of Public Works) architects. The architectural firm Murokami and Associates joined the design process, and the $1.6 million Woh Hei Yuen Recreation Center building was constructed by DPW's construction crew and Lem Construction once the plan was finalized.</p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/wohheiyuen/image4.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Woh Hei Yuen Layout Map (1992)<sup>13</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/wohheiyuen/image5.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Woh Hei Yuen Park<sup>14</sup>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>Today, visitors are welcomed into the \"garden of peace and joy\" through an attractive arched gateway made of sculpted granite. The garden is adorned with slender trees, trellised seats draped with flourishing vines, and flowering bushes bordering the lawn. In one corner of the garden, a wooden bridge crosses over a dry creek, adding to its serene charm. Young children are drawn to the play area, which features a round sandbox, sturdy climbing structures, slides, and shiny plastic cars and tricycles.<sup>15</sup></p>\n                <p>The recreation center boasts two floors, including a roof deck, and is equipped with a multipurpose recreation room that features a children's play nook, a 1,000-square-foot assembly room, and a kitchen. Operating seven days a week, the center offers a wide range of programs for individuals of all ages, ranging from preschoolers to senior citizens. For adults, there are programs such as drama classes, board games, ping-pong, English language courses, exercise sessions, Chinese Lion Dancing, and Kung Fu. Children between the ages of 3 and 14, from eleven different schools, participate in programs offered from Monday to Saturday. These programs include Kindergym, organized games, cooking classes, Chinese language lessons, homework assistance, seasonal sports, karaoke, and activities aimed at developing motor skills.<sup>16</sup></p>\n            </div>\n\n            {/* TODO: Figure out cleaner way to do citations, maybe with a component? */}\n            <details className=\"citations\">\n                <summary>References</summary>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>1</sup> “Woh Hei Yuen Playground Picnic Area,” San Francisco Recreation and Parks, n.d., <a href=\"https://sfrecpark.org/1021/Woh-Hei-Yuen-Playground-Picnic-Area\">https://sfrecpark.org/1021/Woh-Hei-Yuen-Playground-Picnic-Area</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>2</sup> Ryan Kim, “Chinatown Heralds New Park,” SFGATE, October 8, 1999, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/chinatown-heralds-new-park-3273356.php\"> https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/chinatown-heralds-new-park-3273356.php</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>3</sup> Kim, “Chinatown Heralds New Park.”\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>4</sup> “NEW PARK NOW !!!,” Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown, n.d..\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>5</sup> “Editorial: Chinatown Needs A New Park,” East/West, June 6, 1986.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>6</sup> Kim, “Chinatown Heralds New Park.”\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>7</sup> Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown, “NEW PARK NOW !!!.”\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>8</sup> “Cathay Funeral Home, 1213 Powell Street,” San Francisco Public Library, June 19, 1964, <a href=\"https://digitalsf.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A134824?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=982e095ddeca0979c0ee&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=7\">https://digitalsf.org/islandora/object/islandora%3A134824?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=982e095ddeca0979c0ee&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=7</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>9</sup> Dea Collier Irene, “New Park for Chinatown,” Asian Week, June 5, 1987.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>10</sup> Kim, “Chinatown Heralds New Park.”\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>11</sup> Jon Pon Photo Collection.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>12</sup> “Woh Hei Yuen Park,” San Francisco Parks Alliance, May 10, 2012, <a href=\"https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/woh-hei-yuen-park\">https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/woh-hei-yuen-park</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>13</sup> “New Chinatown Park,” Department of Public Works, Landscape Architecture Section, May 14, 1992.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>14</sup> “Woh Hei Yuen Playground Picnic Area,”San Francisco Recreation and Parks, n.d., <a href=\"https://sfrecpark.org/1021/Woh-Hei-Yuen-Playground-Picnic-Area\">https://sfrecpark.org/1021/Woh-Hei-Yuen-Playground-Picnic-Area</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>15</sup> “Woh Hei Yuen Park,” San Francisco Parks Alliance, May 10, 2012, <a href=\"https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/woh-hei-yuen-park\">https://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/woh-hei-yuen-park</a>.\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                    <sup>16</sup> “Woh Hei Yuen Park,” San Francisco Parks Alliance.\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </details>\n            <Footer />\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default WohHeiYuen","import React from 'react';\nimport Footer from '../../components/Footer';\nimport \"./WillyWong.css\";\nimport \"../PageStyle.css\";\n\nconst WillyWong = () => {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"willy-wong-page\">\n            <div className=\"willy-wong-intro\">\n                <h2>Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground</h2>\n                <p>Willie “Woo Woo” Wong playground opened in 1927 on a one-third acre lot bounded by Sacramento Street to the south and Hang Ah Alley to the west.<sup>1</sup> Then known as Chinese Playground, it was, and continues to be, one of the only public outdoor recreational places in Chinatown, serving as an oasis for children who live in crowded conditions and who want an open space to play and socialize. To account for Chinatown’s steep slopes, the playground is split into two levels. At present, the park includes play structures and a clubhouse on the lower terrace and a basketball court, a tennis court, and fitness equipment on the upper terrace.</p>\n                <p>For much of its existence, the Chinese Playground was neglected by the local government and lacked adequate play equipment to serve its thousands of users. In 1968, when real estate developers took interest in the Chinese Playground as a potential site to build a new nine-story parking garage, they offered to construct a small play area on its roof, arguing that it was the only way to fund improvements to the site. Recognizing that a rooftop park would not serve the needs of the community, concerned Chinatown residents, workers and community activists formed an ad hoc group to protest the developer’s proposal. After collecting 5,000 signatures opposing the new parking structure, the group formed the Committee for Better Parks and Recreation in Chinatown (CBPRC).<sup>2</sup></p>\n                <p>The group began meeting monthly in the basement of Cameron House, a historic Church and community-based organization that provides domestic violence case management, counseling services, low-cost summer programming, and other community services. The CBPRC developed a working relationship with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, whereby a City Department staff member attended every meeting. As explained by former CBPRC member Jennie Lew, this partnership reaped many benefits for the Committee: “As we were talking about maintenance, improvement issues, even security problems, or whatever, we had a City staff person right in the meeting. As explained by former CBPRC member Jennie Lew, this partnership reaped many benefits for the committee: “As we were talking about maintenance, improvement issues, even security problems, or whatever, we had a city staff person right in the meeting. They either had the information or they were assigned to go back and get the information for us, and there was local city accountability.”<sup>3</sup> As a result of their effective advocacy, especially their presence at public City Hall meetings, the Board of Supervisors ultimately rejected the developers’ proposal.<sup>4</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image1.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The Chinese Playground before a major renovation and addition of the clubhouse in the 1970s.\n                            <br/>\n                            <i>Courtesy of Jon Pon</i>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br/>\n                <p>However, the CBPRC was not content with simply stopping the bulldozing of the park. The group began to meet with staff members from the Recreation and Parks Department to discuss potential improvements to the park.<sup>5</sup> An anonymous $25,000 donation provided the funding needed.<sup>6</sup> To ensure that the community’s needs were met, the Recreation and Parks Department tasked the CBPRC to develop the playground design.<sup>7</sup> The organization partnered with the Community Design Center (CDC, a Chinatown branch established by Alice Barkley from the main CDC center located then and still now at UC Berkeley Extension in San Francisco) which provided architectural and planning services to underserved communities, including the Western Addition, Hunter’s Point, and Chinatown.<sup>8</sup></p>\n                <p>The CBPRC has always recognized the importance of creating separate play spaces for toddlers and elementary school students. As Jennie Lew puts it: “An eight or twelve-year-old is gonna totally run over someone who is just learning how to walk...”<sup>9</sup> During the design process, CDC and CBPRC members worked directly with youth and children/family related community non-profits to develop ideas. Saint Mary’s School, one of many educational institutions in Chinatown, developed a slideshow entitled “The Poor Little Playground” to solicit input from children.<sup>10</sup> Teams of children used clay, wood, and other materials to build highly expressive and often whimsical models of what they wanted.<sup>11</sup> The CBPRC also developed close relationships with Chinatown child care centers, which relied almost entirely on neighborhood parks to meet outdoor minimum square-foot-per-child requirements to be certified. This allowed CBPRC to obtain valuable design feedback from both the children, parents, and staff working with youth in the community.<sup>12</sup> David Gates and the other landscape architects from Eckbo, Dean, Austin and Williams (EDAW) then volunteered to produce the Construction Documents for the first major Chinese Playground renovation.<sup>13</sup></p>\n                <p>The design for the central area of the playground was completed after a year and a half of robust community engagement and fundraising efforts.<sup>14</sup> Implementing the design, however, required extensive negotiations with various government bodies, including the City Recreation and Parks Commission, the Art Commission, and the Department of Public Works. With the help of Recreation and Parks Department staff, the CBPRC was able to realize a pivotal renovation of the central play area, which served as a model for later phases of improvements, including subsequent addition of a \"tot lot\" area for younger children and a new clubhouse for indoor recreational activities (e.g., ping pong, board games, youth and parent gathering and community meetings).<sup>15</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image2.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The Chinese Playground under construction in 1978.\n                            <br/>\n                            <i>Courtesy of Jon Pon</i>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image3.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The Chinese Playground after major renovations in 1980.\n                            <br/>\n                            <i>Courtesy of Jon Pon</i>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Chinatown Shadow Fights and Prop K, The Shadow Ordinance</h3>\n                <p>In 1982, a powerful Chinatown Family Association put forth plans for a 12-story, $5 million condominium located directly uphill from the Chinese Playground between Stockton Street and Hang Ah Alley. The Ning Yung project proposed 29 luxury housing units above commercial space.<sup>16</sup>  A shadow study conducted by UC Berkeley Emeritus Professor Peter Bosselmann, from the College of Environmental Design Simulation Lab, confirmed that new construction would cast  major shadows over the playground’s tennis, volleyball, and basketball areas as well as the tot lot for 1-3 ½ hours throughout the year. <sup>17</sup> The CBPRC, residents and many other community organizations (e.g., childcare and youth centers, educational and social services) responded with alarm. In a newspaper interview, Jennie Lew argued that “it takes more to making a neighborhood than just housing. Part of it is (also) providing an environment where kids can grow and where a family can sustain itself with shops and places of work.”<sup>18</sup> Ning Yuen attempted to sway garment workers employed in the existing low-rise building (proposed for demolition and replacement by a new mid-rise condominium project) by offering to relocate them. However, many were mothers whose children had actually played at the Chinese Playground. Recognizing the importance of accessible outdoor play spaces to their family and the rest of the community, Asian Law Caucus attorney Ed Lee stated his clients, the on-site garment workers voted to oppose the condominium project in solidarity with the CBPRC.<sup>19</sup> </p>\n                <p>The conflict continued to brew in City Planning Commission meetings for months before a compromise was finally reached. The compromise reduced the height of the building by twenty-seven feet and tapered the side of the building facing the Chinese Playground to allow more sunlight in the late afternoon. As a result, CBPRC ultimately withdrew opposition to the condo project when the Ning Yung Association also made a “good-faith” promise to acquire a new site for a park. The CBPRC also was aware there was no prior premise under the current Environmental Impact Report requirements or City ordinance that shadows could legally prevent new construction approvals or permits. Despite urging from Planning Director Dean Macris, the Planning Commission was hesitant to approve the compromise.<sup>20</sup> The project was finally approved in a contentious 4-3 vote, after heavy lobbying by Mayor Diane Feinstein.<sup>21</sup> In the end, the condominium project was never built. However, the “good-faith” compromise between the  Ning Yuen Association and activist groups would eventually lead to the city’s acquisition and development of the Cathay Mortuary Site as Woh Hei Yuen Park.<sup>22</sup></p>\n                <p>Media coverage of this pivotal battle over shadows on a playground set in one of the densest, most populated, low-income neighborhoods in America established unequivocally the value of sunlight on public open space. Chinatown open space, which had previously taken a back seat to senior and housing issues, now had increased prominence and importance not only in the community, but was now a critical element for land use policies to assess and protect citywide. As Jennie Lew comments: “You live and die if you don’t have housing, right? [That is not the case with] open space. [But, without it], what kind of quality of life do you have?”<sup>23</sup>  The CBPRC continued to push for City funding for summer recreational programs and improved play structures in Ping Yuen public housing complexes and even rooftops (e.g., Chinatown Branch Library, now the Him Mark Lai Library). The CBPRC also advocated in other public hearings for better access, public transit connections, and more culturally and language sensitive features at regional recreational resources like the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and presented Chinatown case studies at a Sierra Club/NAACP joint Conference in Chicago. CBPRC as a leader/innovator in open space preservation and improvement gained prominence.<sup>24</sup> Other organizations in San Francisco began to see that the Chinatown community “knew how to argue for open space…[and were] not just a poor little minority community waiting for handouts.”<sup>25</sup> The extended conversations over the shadowing of parks eventually led to the passing of Prop K, The Shadow Ordinance, which embedded park sunlight protections into San Francisco’s City Charter.<sup>26</sup> Making policy impacts like Prop. K (still in existence and to this day, applied to all new developments proposing added shadows on public open spaces throughout the City), Chinatown emerged as a political force and as “a community to be dealt with.”<sup>27</sup></p>\n                <p>In its earliest days, the CBPRC refused to concede any shadowing, regardless of square footage or time/season of impact if it landed on space that was usable then or potentially for future active or passive enjoyment by the community. Under Prop. K, only insignificant shadows were to be permitted by the City Planning Commission. Now, commercial developers in San Francisco approach community groups to buy off any opposition to their new project shadow impacts. \"Significant or insignificant\" negative shadow impacts before the City Planning Commission or subsequently even at the more politicalized S.F. Board of Supervisors level, are now weighed against enticing \"community benefits\". As a result, many current and proposed new improvements to Chinatown public open space or new affordable housing are funded in whole or in part by negotiated new office development agreements.<sup>28</sup></p>\n                <p>Jennie Lew (CBPRC member that authored the \"shadow ordinance\" with SF Supervisors Bill Maher, Supervisor Lousie Renne and City Rec. and Parks Department General Manager Mary Burns) recalls \"this was not what members of CBPRC had in mind when we conceived and fought for the Prop. K shadow ordinance. The Planning Commission rated Portsmouth Square and the Chinese Playground as where <b><i>NO new shadow would be allowed</i></b>. The whole objective of Prop. K was NOT to have shadow impacts be 'negotiables' on a case-by-case basis for all eternity between developers and CBPRC or other community groups, however, that's what the City and community has now accepted in Chinatown.”<sup>29</sup></p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image4.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            A San Francisco Examiner article written by Gerald Adams from November 1982 covering the fight over the Ning Yung condominium project.\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>In 2006, the Chinese Playground was renamed to honor Willie “Woo Woo” Wong, a local basketball legend. Standing at five foot five inches, Wong grew up across from the playground on Sacramento Street. He would eventually go on to play for the 1945 All-City prep team and the San Francisco Saints, an amateur basketball team composed entirely of Chinese Americans. As a member of the University of San Francisco Dons, he was the first Chinese American basketball player to play at Madison Square Garden. The Willie Wong Playground is the first park in San Francisco named after a Chinese American athlete.<sup>30</sup> </p>\n                <p>The playground continues to be an important community hub for the Chinatown neighborhood. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a non-profit organization called the Community Youth Center (CYC) opened a Community Hub in the playground’s clubhouse as part of San Francisco’s Community Hub Initiative. The initiative provided young people with distance learning support and extracurricular opportunities. The Willie Wong Community Hub focused on serving middle and high school-aged English language learners and those living in public housing and single-room occupancies (SROs).<sup>31</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image5.png')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            The Willie Wong Clubhouse on Waverly Place.\n                            <br/>\n                            <i>Photo taken by Fiona Yim</i>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <h3>Renovating the Willie Wong Playground in 2021</h3>\n                <p>In February 2021, the playground reopened after undergoing major renovations. The $14.5 million project was funded by the 2012 Clean and Safe Neighborhood Parks Bond, the San Francisco Open Space Fund, and the Downtown Park Fund, which requires downtown commercial developers to pay fees to support public services. Working in collaboration with the Chinatown Community Development Center, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department conducted trilingual surveys and focus groups of teens, daycare staff, and seniors. The resulting design includes clear references to Chinese iconography and mythology. In the central play area, a water dragon sculpture loops around a climbable two-level tower. A phoenix sculpture connects two play zones that cater to different age groups. Inside the clubhouse, a mural painted by local artist Julie Chang depicts black and white peonies—which symbolize honor and abundance—along with a red knot symbolizing good fortune and green bamboo lines.<sup>32</sup> </p>\n                <div className=\"imgText\">\n                    <figure>\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/images/willywong/image6.jpg')} className=\"horizontal-img\"/>\n                        <figcaption>\n                            Renderings for the latest redesign of Willie Wong Playground.\n                            <br/>\n                            <i>Courtesy of CMG Landscape Architecture</i>\n                        </figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>Since its inception in 1927, Willie “Woo Woo” Wong Playground has been a battleground for open space issues in Chinatown, pitting young activists against powerful developers over and over again. The fight to preserve this contested space illustrates the importance of community-serving playgrounds. As journalist John King puts it: “These public spaces aren’t simply decoration.
